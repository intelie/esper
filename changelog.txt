Changes in version 3.1.0
------------------------

Major API changes
  - The behavior of "timer:within" when used within an "every" in a pattern has changed: The sub-expression qualified by "timer-within" upon expiry 
    of the timer now evaluates to permanently false, while previously it simple stopped. This allows the "every" operator to restart such sub-expression.
    For example, the expression:
      every(A -> (B where timer:within(5 sec)))
    ... When no B event arrives after an A event, the "every" restarts the subexpression looking for the next A followed by B within 5 sec.
  - The PluginLoader interface for writing adapters has a new required method that must be implemented to allow plugins to initialize after complete Esper engine initialization.
  - The provider URI of the default engine instance is now "default" instead of null.
    This is for consistency with the default engine qualifier for optional use in stream and property name qualification, which is also "default".
    Therefore EPServiceProviderManager.getDefaultProvider().getURI() returns "default", and passing null to the EPServiceProviderManager still returns the default instance.

New Features
  - A new "every-distinct" operator has been introduced to the pattern language. Very similar to the "every" operator, this operator
    suppresses duplicate results received from sub-expressions based on a set of expressions returning distinct-values.
  - The EPL language now understands annotations following the annotation syntax standard.
    An annotation is an addition made to information in a statement. Esper provides certain built-in annotations for
    defining statement name (@Name), adding a statement description (@Description) or for tagging statements.
    Applications can provide their own annotation classes that the EPL compiler can populate.
  - The engine now provides a way to prioritize and preempt processing of an event when multiple statements must process the event,
    via the @Priority and @Drop annotations.
  - The insert-into clause can now directly populate an underlying event object from a select clause.
  - We have extended the on-insert syntax by a new split-stream syntax. This allows to list multiple insert-into, select clauses and where-clauses
    thereby making it easy to split or duplicate an event stream into multiple further event streams.

Minor changes  
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-350 Timer-Within should evaluate to permanently false allowing every to restart the expression
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-349 Exception barrier to lock taken missing from filter processing potentially causing deadlock after an exception occurs
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-348 XML event type fails to be configured with XSD on Java 6
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-347 NullPointer with time_batch and START_EAGER with named window
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-346 NullPointerException in on-select with aggregation and empty window
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-345 NPE is thrown when evaluating statement with 'OR' in its having-clause.
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-344 Pattern cleanup incomplete causing memory leaks
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-343 Esper shouldn't log ExprValidationException
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-341 Variable used with XML no-schema event in same statement creates ambigous property exception
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-340 Lost of precision using BigDecimal for arithematic operation
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-339 Parse error when using "every" in combination with repeat

  - Fixed Issue ESPER-335 pluginloader stop called after engine runtime destroy
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-334 PluginLoader reentrancy on Configuration

  - Fixed Issue ESPER-332 NullPointerException in on-select with having clause for timer excution
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-331 Runtime exception barrier for listener and subscriber
  - Fixed Issue ESPER-328 Aggregation function nested created NPE in Timer thread
  

Changes in version 3.0.0
------------------------

Major API changes
  - Please see http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ESPER/Migrating+Esper+2.x+to+3.0  
    The summary of changes are:
    - Upgraded version of dependent jar files 
    - Moved EventType, EventBean and related exception classes from package com.espertech.esper.event to com.espertech.esper.client
    - Several minor rename of methods in the Configuration API related to event type name retiring "alias" as a word in method names
    - EPL division expressions yield double-type results
    - EPL view and pattern parameters strongly distinquish between string constant and property name
    - EPL join statements for certain stream types now require a data window declaration
    - EPL when using multiple data windows defaults to intersection semantics
    - Extension API for views, pattern objects and event representations have additional or slighly changed signatures
    
New Features
  - The view parameters and pattern object parameters are now expressions. Thereby they gain certain new features: 
    - Variables may be used to parameterize views or pattern objects; 
    - Prepared statements may use substitution parameters to parameterize views and pattern objects;
    - Pattern objects may be parameterized by prior events;
    - The syntax for views namespace.name('property') is no longer supported.
  - New syntax to support contained-event selection, for use with coarse-grained events that contain finer-grained events or rows.
    This allows convenient extraction and analysis of information from business-level composite events.    
  - Added XML and JSON renderers for output events
  - When using multiple data windows for the same stream in EPL, the default policy is intersection of data windows, and a union-policy is also available via keyword. 
    This allows concise declaration and combination of multiple expiry policies and well-defined semantics.
  - We have made substantial internal enhancements to the type system to simplify and support transposing from any type of stream to an event property in a further stream.
  - Enhanced the XML DOM event to support: The changes gained features to transposing XPath expression results between statements and including arrays,
    as well as transposing property expression results. The changes also correct a problem in which an expression "index[1]" accessed the firs element in a collection and not the second.
  - Added a new method for statements to add a listener with replay in one transaction, by name "addListenerWithReplay".
  - The EPL now returns a double-type result for division expressions where both operands to a division were non-FP types, such as "1/2", i.e. double 0.5. 
    This follows SQL standards and makes EPL easier to read and use. Esper 2.x returned an integer value following Java standards (i.e. zero).
  - The EPL does no longer assume keep-all semantics if no data window is specified for a filter-based or pattern-based stream in a join. 
    EPL now requires a data window to be explicitly defined to applicable streams.   
  - Added support for SQL-standard ANY, SOME and ALL keywords in group comparison.  
  - Added advanced threading options to configuration for use with inbound, outbound and execution threading at engine-level.  
  - Improved support for Java-object event representation with parameterized types (Java generics), List and Iterable properties.  
  - Added support for escaping property names and event type names in case an overlap occurs with keywords.
  - New configuration options to change the caching behavior for UDF invocations.

  - Removed "indicator.jmx" package.
  - Removed "emit" method from EPRuntime and EmittedListener.
  - Removed examples LinearRoad, RSI and ATM.
  - The Maven build no longer compiles the grammar. The grammar is now compiled via "esper/grammar/antlrtool.bat" or "antlrtool.sh". The resulting parser is
    part of the source code base.

* (Docs and Examples) New chapter on Event Representations


Changes in version 1.0.0
------------------------
* (EQL) Added support for invoking Java library static methods, invoking user-defined static methods, and defining an auto-import list
* (EQL) Sort view ext:sort now also allowing multiple columns to sort on
* (EQL) Added NOT, modulo (%) and SQL string concatention operator (||)
* (EQL) New example 'Market Feed Monitor' which showcases rate calculation and fall-off detection. With a simulator that 
can be run from command line. 
* (build) Build scripts now build Linux tarball; Shell scripts for compiling and running examples reworked.


Changes in version 0.9.5
------------------------
* (EQL) Capability added to sort output using an "order-by" clause
* (EQL) Support for bit-wise AND (&), OR (|) and XOR(^) operators
* (EQL) Bug fix for allowing boolean expression in select clauses, such as "select a and b from MyEvent..."
* (EQL) Added support for "insert into" thus allowing chains of EQL statements, and merging of event streams

Changes in version 0.9.1
------------------------
* (EQL) Bug fix for statements that contain only aggregation functions in the select clause such as 
"select sum(volume) from StockTick". The engine was incorrectly posting an event per event posted 
by the stream's window, rather then a single aggregate event.
* (EQL) Bug fix for group-by without output rate limiting. This problem occured using a group-by clause
without output rate limit and resulted in multiple events posted that include prior groups for each event posted 
by the window.
* (EQL) New example 'Transaction 3-event challenge' which shows EQL in use for detecting missing events and
computing latency totals overall and grouped. Added scripts for compiling and executing the example.


Changes in version 0.9.0
------------------------------------
* (EQL) Now supporting outer joins for an unlimited number of event streams
* (EQL) Support for output rate limiting based on number of events and time-based, and choice of last or all events

Changes in version 0.8.5
------------------------
* (EQL) Added support for the group-by clause and the having-clause
* (EQL) Added support for aggregation functions in the select and having-clauses; The list of aggregation functions is: 
max, min, sum, avg, count, median, stddev, avedev; The "distinct" keyword is also supported for each; The "count(*)" syntax is supported.
* (EQL) Group-by view has been renamed from "std:group" to "std:groupby" since group is a reserved keyword
* (EQL) The univariate statistics view "stat:uni" changed the name of derived event properties to "stddev" and "stddevpa" from formerly 
"stdev" and "stdevpa" to stay consistent with the aggregate functions of the same name


Changes in version 0.8.0
------------------------
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Event inheritance and interface implementation support; Added support for interfaces, 
abstract classes, superclasses. E.g. select * from IMyEvent  (where IMyEvent) is an interface or superclass, and event classes that 
implement this interface or extend the superclass match the criteria.
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Added support for simple, mapped, indexed, nested and any combination of these anywhere where
and event property name is expected. E.g. subordinate[3].address(home).city
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Refined exception texts to better indicate syntax errors or messages in validating pattern and EQL statements
during statement creation. Added EPStatementSyntaxException and EPStatementException.


Changes in version 0.7.5
------------------------
* (API) A configuration can now optionally be supplied to an engine instance via the Configuration parameter to EPServiceProviderManager.
This enabled event patterns and EQL to use short event names not requiring making the fully-qualified Java class name optional
* (EQL) Outer joins: left, right and full join on 2 streams
* (EQL) IS NULL, = NULL, IS NOT NULL, <> and != now supported in where clause

* (Event Pattern) improved removal of permanently false patterns (e.g. B arrives in 'A and not B')
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Removed requirement that event names have () postfix, e.g. 'every A=X' equivalent to 'every A=X()'
* (Documentation) new section on builtin functions
* (Examples) Sample ATM added to show simple join
