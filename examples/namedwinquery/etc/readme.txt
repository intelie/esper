Esper Examples
==============

In order to compile and run the samples please follow the below instructions:

1. Make sure Java 1.6 or greater is installed and the JAVA_HOME environment variable is set

2. Open a console window and change directory to esper/examples/etc

3. Run "setenv.bat" (Windows) or "setenv.sh" (Unix) to verify your environment settings

4. Run "compile.bat" (Windows) or "compile.sh" (Unix) to compile the examples
   On Unix systems, make sure the PATH variable contains the current directory.

5. Now you are ready to run the examples. Some examples require mandatory parameters.

6. For details on the type of data generated by each simulator, please consult the example documentation in the documentation set.

The examples can produce lots of pretty detailed output. The logging level can be configured by changing the 
log4j.xml configuration file to DEBUG for more output or to INFO for less detailed output.


Samples description
===================


The Market Data Feed Monitor
----------------------------

	Run "run_mktdatafeed.bat" (Windows) or "run_mktdatafeed.sh" (Unix) for this example.
	The mandatory arguments are: <number of threads> <rate drop probability percent> <number of seconds>
	
	Some suggested parameters:
		run_mktdatafeed.bat 1 20 60	// Starts 1 threads the send events for each feed in a loop 
									// There is a 20% chance that a random feed's rate drops to 60% of the target rate	
									// Runs the example for 60 seconds
		Note: Likely you will also see feed rate drop-offs as the VM garbage collection kicks in 

	Please see the documentation set on the type of data generated by this simulator.
