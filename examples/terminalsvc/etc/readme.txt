Esper J2EE Self-Service Terminal Example
==============

The J2EE Self-Service Terminal Example can currently only be compiled with Maven. Enter "mvn package" for a complete build.
The packaged EAR file is located in the target directory of the EAR project.

Follow these steps to run the example:
1. Bring up your JBoss application server instance by entering "run" in the JBoss bin directory
2. Deploy the EAR file to your JBoss home under "server/default/deploy", confirm JBoss deploys the application
3. Copy all jar files from <install-home>/esper/lib to <install-home>/examples/lib
4. Run the receiver
5. Run the sender


Running the receiver (outbound queue listener)
--------------------

Run "run_terminalsvc_receiver.bat" (Windows) or "run_terminalsvc_receiver.sh" (Unix) to attach to the JBoss outbound queue
and listen for events that are posted by the MDB.

The optional arguments are: <provider url>

If not supplied, the provider url defaults to "localhost:1099"


Running the sender (inbound queue producer/simulator)
--------------------

Run "run_terminalsvc_sender.bat" (Windows) or "run_terminalsvc_sender.sh" (Unix) to attach to the JBoss inbound queue,
generate and send events for processing by MDB instances.

The optional arguments are: <provider url>

If not supplied, the provider url defaults to "localhost:1099"

Please see the documentation set on the type of data generated by this simulator.
