	Run "run_servershell.bat" (Windows) or "run_servershell.sh" (Unix) to start the JMS server.
	
	In order to generate some traffic for the JMS server, use the server shell client to send messages and to remotely create a statement:	
	
	Run "run_servershellclient.bat" (Windows) or "run_servershellclient.sh" (Unix) to start the JMS server.
