2. Open a console window and change directory to esper/examples/etc

3. Run "setenv.bat" (Windows) or "setenv.sh" (Unix) to verify your environment settings

4. Run "compile.bat" (Windows) or "compile.sh" (Unix) to compile the examples
   On Unix systems, make sure the PATH variable contains the current directory.

5. Now you are ready to run the examples. Some examples require mandatory parameters.

6. For details on the type of data generated by each simulator, please consult the example documentation in the documentation set.

The examples can produce lots of pretty detailed output. The logging level can be configured by changing the
