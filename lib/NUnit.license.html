<h4>License Note</h4>
<p>This license is based on <A href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.html">
the open source zlib/libpng license</A>. The idea was to keep the license 
as simple as possible to encourage use of NUnit in free and commercial 
applications and libraries, but to keep the source code together and to give 
credit to the NUnit contributors for their efforts. While this license allows 
shipping NUnit in source and binary form, if shipping a NUnit variant is the 
sole purpose of your product, please <a href="mailto:cpoole@pooleconsulting.com">let 
us know</a>.</p>
