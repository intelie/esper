        <title>JMS Server Shell and Client</title>

        <sect2 id="examples-servershell-processes">
			<title>Overview</title>
			<para>
				The server shell is a Java Messaging Service (JMS) -based server that listens to messages on a JMS destination, and sends the received events into Esper. The example also demonstrates a Java Management Extension (JMX) MBean that allows remote dynamic statement management. This server has been designed to run with either Tibco (TM) Enterprise Messaging System (Tibco EMS), or with Apache ActiveMQ, controlled by a properties file.			
			</para>
	
			<para>
				The server shell has been created as an alternative to the EsperIO Spring JMSTemplate adapter.  The server shell is a low-latency processor for byte messages. It employs JMS listeners to process message in multiple threads, this model reduces thread context switching for many JMS providers. The server is configurable and has been tested with two JMS providers. It consists of only 10 classes and is thus easy to understand.
			</para>

			<para>
				The server shell sample comes with a client (server shell client) that sends events into the JMS-based server, and that also creates a statement on the server remotely through a JMX MBean proxy class.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				The server shell classes for this example live in package <literal>com.espertech.esper.example.servershell</literal>. 
				Configure the server to point to your JMS provider by changing the properties in the file <literal>servershell_config.properties</literal> in the <literal>etc</literal> folder.
				Make sure your JMS provider (ActiveMQ or Tibco EMS) is running, then run "run_servershell.bat" (Windows) or "run_servershell.sh" (Unix) to start the JMS server. 
			</para>

			<para>
				Start the server shell process first before starting the client, since the client also demonstrates remote statement management through JMX by attaching to the server process.
			</para>
	
			<para>		
				The client classes to the server shell can be found in package <literal>com.espertech.esper.example.servershellclient</literal>. 
				The client shares the same configuration file as the server shell.
				Run "run_servershellclient.bat" (Windows) or "run_servershellclient.sh" (Unix) to start the JMS producer client  that includes a JMX client as well. 
			</para>
	
		</sect2>

        <sect2 id="examples-servershell-jmsevents">
			<title>JMS Messages as Events</title>
			
			<para>
				The server shell starts a configurable number of JMS <literal>MessageListener</literal> instances that listen to a given JMS destination. The listeners expect a <literal>BytesMessage</literal> that contain a String payload. The payload consists of an IP address and a double-typed duration value separated by a comma.
			</para>

			<para>
				Each listener extracts the payload of a message, constructs an event object and sends the event into the shared Esper engine instance. 
			</para>
				
			<para>
				At startup time, the server creates a single EPL statement with the Esper engine that prints out the average duration per IP address for the last 10 seconds of events, and that specifies an output rate of 2 seconds. By running the server and then the client, you can see the output of the averages every 2 seconds.
			</para>

			<para>
				The server shell client acts as a JMS producer that sends 1000 events with random IP addresses and durations.
			</para>
		</sect2>

        <sect2 id="examples-servershell-jmx">
			<title>JMX for Remote Dynamic Statement Management</title>

			<para>
				The server shell is also a JMX server providing an RMI-based connector. The server shell exposes a JMX MBean that allows remote statement management. The JMX MBean allows to create a statement remotely, attach a listener to the statement and destroy a statement remotely. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The server shell client, upon startup, obtains a remote instance of the management MBean exposed by the server shell. It creates a statement through the MBean that filters out all durations greater then the value 9.9. 
				After sending 1000 events, the client then destroys the statement remotely on the server.

        <title>Market Data Feed Monitor</title>

		<para>
			This example processes a raw market data feed. It reports throughput statistics and

			we want to alert when there is a possible problem with the feed.
		</para>

				For the throughput statistics and to detect rapid fall-off we calculate a ticks per second rate for each market data feed. 
			</para>

			<para>
				We can use an EPL statement that specifies a view onto the market data event stream that batches together 1 second of events. 
				We specify the feed and a count of events per feed as output values. To make this data available for further processing, we
				insert output events into the TicksPerSecond event stream:

			</para>

			<para>
				We can compute the average number of ticks per second over the last 10 seconds simply by using the TicksPerSecond events computed by the

				Note that as the Java VM garbage collection kicks in, the example generates rate drop-offs during such pauses.
			</para>

			<para>
				The second parameter is a rate drop probability parameter specifies the probability in percent that the simulator drops the rate

    <sect1 id="examples-ohlcpluginview">
        <title>OHLC Plug-in View</title>
        <para>
			This example contains a fully-functional custom view based on the extension API that computes OHLC open-high-low-close bars for events that provide a long-typed timestamp and a double-typed value.
        </para>

        <para>
			OHLC bar is a problem out of the financial domain. The "Open" refers to the first datapoint and the "Close" to the last datapoint in an interval. The "High" refers to the maximum and the "Low" to the minimum value during each interval. The term "bar" is used to describe each interval results of these 4 values.
        </para>

        <para>
			The example provides an OHLC view that is hardcoded to 1-minute bars. It considers the timestamp value carried by each event, and not the system time. The cutoff time after which an event is no longer considered for a bar is hardcoded to 5 seconds.
        </para>

        <para>
			The view assumes that events arrive in timestamp order: Each event's timestamp value is equal to or higher then the timestamp value provided by the prior event.
        </para>

        <para>
			The view may also be used together with <literal>std:groupwin</literal> to group per criteria, such as symbol. In this case the assumption of timestamp order applies per symbol.
        </para>

        <para>
			The view gracefully handles no-event and late-event scenarios. Interval boundaries are defined by system time, thus event timestamp and system time must roughly be in-sync, unless using external timer events.

			<title>The Events</title>

			<para>
	The use case involves tracking three components of a transaction. It‘s important that we use at least three components, since some engines have different performance or coding for only two events per transaction. Each component comes to the engine as an event with the following fields:
			</para>
	
			<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
				<listitem>
					<para>

					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>

				In event A:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
				<listitem>

				In event C:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist spacing="compact">

		</sect2>

        <sect2 id="examples-txn3event-2" >

			<para>
What we‘re doing here is matching the transaction IDs on each event, to form an aggregate event. If all these events were in a relational database, this could be done as a simple SQL join… except that with 10,000 events per second, you will need some serious database hardware to do it.

	To make things harder, we don‘t want transaction events coming in order. This code ensures that they come completely out of order. To do this, we fill in a bucket with events and, when the bucket is full, we shuffle it. The buckets are sized so that some transactions‘ events will be split between buckets. So, you have a fairly randomized flow of events, representing the worst case from a big, distributed infrastructure.
				</para>
	
				<para>
	The generator lets you change the size of the bucket (small, medium, large, larger, largerer). The larger the bucket size, the more events potentially come in between two events in a given transaction and so, the more the performance characteristics like buffers, hashes/indexes and other structures are put to the test as the bucket size increases.

			The example is about a J2EE-based self-service terminal managing system in an airport that gets a lot of events from connected terminals. The event rate is around 500 events per second. Some events indicate abnormal situations such as 'paper low' or 'terminal out of order'. Other events observe activity as customers use a terminal to check in and print boarding tickets.

			<para>
				All events provide information about the terminal that published the event, and a timestamp. The terminal information is held in a property named "term" and provides a terminal id. Since all events carry similar information, we model each event as a subtype to a base class BaseTerminalEvent, which will provide the terminal information that all events share. This enables us to treat all terminal events polymorphically, that is we can treat derived event types just like their parent event types. This helps simplify our queries.
			</para>

			<para>
				All terminals publish Status events every 1 minute. In normal cases, the Status events indicate that a terminal is alive and online. The absence of status events may indicate that a terminal went offline for some reason and that may need to be investigated.

				A customer may be in the middle of a check-in when the terminal detects a hardware problem or when the network goes down. In that situation we want to alert a team member to help the customer. When the terminal detects a problem, it issues an OutOfOrder event. A pattern can find situations where the terminal indicates out-of-order and the customer is in the middle of the check-in process:
			</para>

			<title>Absence of Status Events</title>

			<para>
				Since Status events arrive in regular intervals of 60 seconds, we can make us of temporal pattern matching using timer to find events that didn't arrive. We can use the every operator and timer:interval() to repeat an action every 60 seconds. Then we combine this with a not operator to check for absence of Status events. A 65 second interval during which we look for Status events allows 5 seconds to account for a possible delay in transmission or processing:
