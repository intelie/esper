        <title>The Service Provider Interface</title>

		<indexterm><primary>EPServiceProviderManager class</primary></indexterm>

        <para>
			The <literal>EPServiceProvider</literal> interface represents an engine instance. Each instance of an Esper engine is completely independent of other engine instances and has its own administrative and runtime interface.
        </para>

        <para>
			An instance of the Esper engine is obtained via static methods on the <literal>EPServiceProviderManager</literal> class.
			The <literal>getDefaultProvider</literal> method and the <literal>getProvider(String providerURI)</literal> methods return an instance of the Esper engine.
			The latter can be used to obtain multiple instances of the engine for different provider URI values. The <literal>EPServiceProviderManager</literal>
			determines if the provider URI matches all prior provider URI values and returns the same engine instance for the same provider URI value. If the provider URI has not been seen before, it creates a new engine instance.
        </para>

        <para>
			The code snipped below gets the default instance Esper engine. Subsequent calls to get the default engine instance return the same instance.
        </para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[EPServiceProvider epService = EPServiceProviderManager.getDefaultProvider();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
			This code snippet gets an Esper engine for the provider URI <literal>RFIDProcessor1</literal>. Subsequent calls to get an engine with the same provider URI return the same instance.
        </para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[EPServiceProvider epService = EPServiceProviderManager.getProvider("RFIDProcessor1");]]></programlisting>
      
        <para>
			Since the <literal>getProvider</literal> methods return the same cached engine instance for each URI, there is no need to statically cache an engine instance in your application.
			An existing Esper engine instance can be reset via the <literal>initialize</literal> method on the <literal>EPServiceProvider</literal> instance. This operation stops and removes all statements and 
			resets the engine to the configuration provided when the engine instance was originally obtained. After an <literal>initialize</literal> the engine is ready for use.
        </para>

        <para>
			An existing Esper engine instance can be reset via the <literal>initialize</literal> method on the <literal>EPServiceProvider</literal> instance. This operation stops and removes all statements in the Engine as well as restores the engine to the original configuration supplied when the engine instance for that URI was obtained. If no configuration is provided, an empty configuration applies.
        </para>

        <para>
			The next code snippet outlines a typical sequence of use: 
        </para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[// Configure the engine, this is optional
Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.configure("configuration.xml");	// load a configuration from file
config.set....(...);    // make additional configuration settings

// Obtain an engine instance
EPServiceProvider epService = EPServiceProviderManager.getDefaultProvider(config);

// Optionally, use initialize if the same engine instance has been used before to start clean
epService.initialize();

// Optionally, make runtime configuration changes
epService.getEPAdministrator().getConfiguration().add...(...);

// Destroy the engine instance when no longer needed, frees up resources
epService.destroy();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
			An existing Esper engine instance can be destroyed via the <literal>destroy</literal> method on the <literal>EPServiceProvider</literal> instance. This stops and removes all statements
			as well as frees all resources held by the instance. After a <literal>destroy</literal> the engine can no longer be used.
        </para>

        <para>
			The <literal>EPServiceStateListener</literal> interface may be implemented by your application to receive callbacks when an engine instance is about to be destroyed and after an engine instance has been initialized. Listeners are registered via the <literal>addServiceStateListener</literal> method. The <literal>EPStatementStateListener</literal> interface is used to receive callbacks when a new statement gets created and when a statement gets started, stopped or destroyed. Listeners are registered via the <literal>addStatementStateListener</literal> method.

                                    This is the fastest method to receive statement results, as the engine delivers strongly-typed results directly to your application objects without the need for
                                    building an <literal>EventBean</literal> result set as in the Listener Callback choice.

                                    There can be at most 1 Subscriber Object registered per statement. If you require more than one listener, use the Listener Callback instead (or in addition).
                                    The Subscriber Object is bound to the statement with a strongly typed support which ensure direct delivery of new events without type conversion. This optimization
                                    is made possible because there can only be 0 or 1 Subscriber Object per statement.

				Your application may attach one or more listeners, zero or one single subscriber and in addition use the Pull API on the same statement. There are no limitations to the use of iterator, subscriber or listener
				alone or in combination to receive statement results.
			</para>
			<para>
				The best delivery performance can generally be achieved by attaching a subscriber and by not attaching listeners.
                The engine is aware of the listeners and subscriber attached to a statement. The engine uses this information internally to reduce statement overhead. For example, if your statement does not have listeners or a subscriber attached, the engine does not need to continuously generate results for delivery.

			<para>
				A subscriber object is a direct binding of query results to a Java object. The object, a POJO, receives statement results via method invocation. The subscriber class need not implement an interface or extend a superclass.
			</para>
			
			<para>
			  Subscriber objects have several advantages over listeners. First, they offer a substantial performance benefit: Query results are delivered directly to your method(s) through Java virtual machine method calls, and there is no intermediate representation (<literal>EventBean</literal>). Second, as subscribers receive strongly-typed parameters, the subscriber code tends to be simpler.
			</para>

			<para>
			  This chapter describes the requirements towards the methods provided by your subscriber class.

			<orderedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Each evert in the insert stream results in a method invocation, and each event in the remove stream results in further method invocations. This is termed <emphasis>row-by-row delivery</emphasis>.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						A single method invocation that delivers all rows of the insert and remove stream. This is termed <emphasis>multi-row</emphasis> delivery.

				<title>Row-By-Row Delivery</title>
	
				<indexterm><primary>subscriber object</primary><secondary>row-by-row</secondary></indexterm>
				<para>
					Your subscriber class must provide a method by name <literal>update</literal> to receive insert stream events row-by-row. The number and types of parameters declared by the <literal>update</literal> method must match the number and types of columns as specified in the <literal>select</literal> clause, in the same order as in the <literal>select</literal> clause.

					For example, if your statement is:
				</para>

				<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
					<listitem>
						<para>

					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Auto-boxing and unboxing follows Java standards. For example, if your <literal>select</literal> clause selects an <literal>java.lang.Integer</literal> value, the method parameter for the same column can be typed <literal>int</literal>.

			<para>			
				EPL statements and event patterns publish old data and new data to registered <literal>UpdateListener</literal> listeners.

				Old data published by statements constists of the events representing the prior values of derived data held by the statement.
			</para>		

			<para>			
				It is important to understand that <literal>UpdateListener</literal> listeners receive multiple result rows in one invocation by the engine: the new data and old data parameters to your listener are array parameters. For example, if your application uses one of the batch data windows, or your application creates a pattern that matches multiple times when a single event arrives, then the engine indicates such multiple result rows in one invocation and your new data array carries two or more rows.

				A second listener interface is the <literal>StatementAwareUpdateListener</literal> interface. A <literal>StatementAwareUpdateListener</literal> is especially useful for registering the same listener object with multiple statements,

				</para>
					
				<para>
					When using the <literal>addListenerWithReplay</literal> method to register a listener, the listener receives current statement results as the first call to the update method of the listener, passing in the newEvents parameter the current statement results as an array of zero or more events. Subsequent calls to the update method of the listener are statement results.

			<para>
				Subscribing to events posted by a statement is following a push model. The engine pushes data to listeners when events are received that cause data to change or patterns to match. Alternatively, you need to know that statements serve up data that your application can obtain via the <literal>safeIterator</literal> and <literal>iterator</literal> methods on <literal>EPStatement</literal>. This is called the pull API and can come in handy if your application is not interested in all new updates, and only needs to perform a frequent or infrequent poll for the latest data. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The <literal>safeIterator</literal> method on <literal>EPStatement</literal> returns a concurrency-safe iterator returning current statement results, even while concurrent threads may send events into the engine for processing. The safe iterator guarantees correct results even as events are being processed by other threads. The cost is that the iterator obtains and holds a statement lock that must be released via the <literal>close</literal> method on the <literal>SafeIterator</literal> instance. 
			</para>

			<para>
				The <literal>iterator</literal> method on <literal>EPStatement</literal> returns a concurrency-unsafe iterator. This iterator is only useful for applications that are single-threaded, or applications that themselves perform coordination between the iterating thread and the  threads that send events into the engine for processing. The advantage to this iterator is that it does not hold a lock.
			</para>

			<para>
				The next code snippet shows a short example of use of safe iterators:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[EPStatement statement = epAdmin.createEPL("select avg(price) as avgPrice from MyTick");
// .. send events into the engine
// then use the pull API...
SafeIterator<EventBean> safeIter = statement.safeIterator();
try {
  for (;safeIter.hasNext();) {
     // .. process event ..
     EventBean event = safeIter.next();
     System.out.println("avg:" + event.get("avgPrice");
  }
}
finally {
  safeIter.close();	// Note: safe iterators must be closed
}]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				This is a short example of use of the regular iterator that is not safe for concurrent event processing:
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[double averagePrice = (Double) eplStatement.iterator().next().get("average");]]></programlisting>
			
			<para>
				The <literal>safeIterator</literal> and <literal>iterator</literal> methods can be used to pull results out of all statements, including statements that join streams, contain aggregation functions, pattern statements, and statements that contain a <literal>where</literal> clause, <literal>group by</literal> clause, <literal>having</literal> clause or <literal>order by</literal> clause.
			</para>

			<para>
				For statements without an <literal>order by</literal> clause, the <literal>iterator</literal> method returns events in the order maintained by the data window. For statements that contain an <literal>order by</literal> clause, the <literal>iterator</literal> method returns events in the order indicated by the <literal>order by</literal> clause.
			</para>

			<para>
				Consider using the <literal>on-select</literal> clause and a named window if your application requires iterating over a partial result set or requires indexed access for fast iteration; Note that <literal>on-select</literal> requires that you sent a trigger event, which may contain the key values for indexed access.

			</para>
	
			<orderedlist spacing="compact">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						In multithreaded applications, use the <literal>safeIterator</literal> method. Note: make sure your application closes the iterator via the <literal>close</literal> method when done, otherwise the iterated statement stays locked and event processing for that statement does not resume.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						In multithreaded applications, the <literal>iterator</literal> method does not hold any locks. The iterator returned by this method does not make any guarantees towards correctness of results and fail-behavior, if your application processes events into the engine instance by multiple threads. Use the <literal>safeIterator</literal> method for concurrency-safe iteration instead.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Since the <literal>safeIterator</literal> and <literal>iterator</literal> methods return events to the application immediately, the iterator does not honor an output rate limiting clause, if present. That is, the iterator returns results as if there is no output-rate clause for the statement in statements without grouping or aggregation. For statements with grouping or aggregation, the iterator in combintion with an output clause returns last output group and aggregation results. Use a separate statement and the <literal>insert into</literal> clause to control the output rate for iteration, if so required.

			The <literal>EPRuntime</literal> interface is used to send events for processing into an Esper engine, set and get variable values and execute on-demand queries.
        </para>
        
        <para>
			The below code snippet shows how to send a Java object event to the engine. Note that the <literal>sendEvent</literal> method is overloaded. As events can take on different representation classes in Java, the <literal>sendEvent</literal> takes parameters to reflect the different 
			types of events that can be send into the engine. The <xref linkend="event_representation"/> section explains the types of events 
			accepted.

// Send an example event containing stock market data
runtime.sendEvent(new MarketDataBean('IBM', 75.0));		
]]></programlisting>

        <para>
			Events, in theoretical terms, are observations of a state change that occurred in the past. Since one cannot change an event that happened in the past, events are best modelled as immutable objects. 
        </para>

        <para>
			Note that the Esper engine relies on events that are sent into an engine to not change their state. Typically, applications create a new event object for every new event, to represent that new event. Application should not modify an existing event that was sent into the engine.
        </para>

        <para>
			Another important method in the runtime interface is the <literal>route</literal> method. This method is designed for use by <literal>UpdateListener</literal> and subscriber implementations that
			need to send events into an engine instance to avoid the possibility of a stack overflow due to nested calls to <literal>sendEvent</literal>.

			<para>
				For events backed by a Java class (JavaBean events), the event sender ensures that the event object equals the underlying class, or implements or extends the underlying class
				for the given event type name.
			</para>

				For events backed by a org.w3c.Node (XML DOM events), the event sender checks that the root element name equals the root element name for the event type.

				A second method to obtain an event sender is the method <literal>getEventSender(URI[])</literal>, which takes an array of URIs. This method is for use with plug-in event representations.

				For an event to become unmatched by any statement, the event must not match any statement's event stream filter criteria. Note that the EPL  <literal>where</literal> clause or <literal>having</literal> clause are not considered part of the filter criteria for a stream, as explained by example below.
			</para>
			<para>
				In the next statement all MyEvent events match the statement's event stream filter criteria, regardless of the value of the 'quantity' property. As long as the below statement remains started, the engine would not deliver MyEvent events to your registered <literal>UnmatchedListener</literal> instance:

				The <literal>EventPropertyDescriptor</literal> contains flags that indicate whether a property is an indexed (array) or a mapped property and whether access to property values require an integer index value (indexed properties only) or string key value (mapped properties only). The descriptor also contains a fragment flag that indicates whether a property value is available as a fragment.

			<para>
				A fragment event type and thereby fragment events allow navigation over a statement's results even if the statement result contains nested events or a graph of events. There is no need to use the Java reflection API to navigate events,

			</para>

			<para>
				Composite events are events that aggregate one or more other events. Composite events are typically created by the engine for statements that join two event streams, and for event patterns in which the causal events are retained and reported in a composite event. The example below shows such an event pattern.

}]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Note that the <literal>update</literal> method can receive multiple events at once as it accepts an array of <literal>EventBean</literal> instances. For example, a time batch window may post multiple events to listeners representing a batch of events received during a given time period. 
			</para>
				
			<para>
				Pattern statements can also produce multiple events delivered to update listeners in one invocation. The pattern statement below, for instance, delivers an event for each A event that was not followed by a B event with the same <literal>id</literal> property within 60 seconds of the A event. The engine may deliver all matching A events as an array of events in a single invocation of the <literal>update</literal> method of each listener to the statement:

			Esper is designed from the ground up to operate as a component to multi-threaded, highly-concurrent applications that require efficient use of Java VM resources. In addition, multi-threaded execution requires guarantees in predictability of results and deterministic processing. This section discusses these concerns in detail. 
        </para>

		<para>
In Esper, an engine instance is a unit of separation. Applications can obtain and discard (initialize) one or more engine instances within the same Java VM and can provide the same or different engine configurations to each instance. An engine instance efficiently shares resources between statements. For example, consider two statements that declare the same data window. The engine matches up view declarations provided by each statement and can thus provide a single data window representation shared between the two statements.
        </para>

        <para>
			Applications can use Esper APIs to concurrently, by multiple threads of execution, perform such functions as creating and 
managing statements, or sending events into an engine instance for processing. Applications can use application-managed thread pools or any set of same or different threads of execution with any of the public Esper APIs. There are no restrictions towards threading other then those noted in specific sections of this document. 
        </para>
        
        <para>
Esper does not prescribe a specific threading model. Applications using Esper retain full control over threading, allowing an engine to be easily embedded and used as a component or library in your favorite Java container or process.
        </para>

        <para>
In the default configuration it is up to the application code to use multiple threads for processing events by the engine, if so desired. All event processing takes places within your application thread call stack. The exception is timer-based processing if your engine instance relies on the internal timer (default). If your application relies on external timer events instead of the internal timer then there need not be any Esper-managed internal threads.
        </para>

        <para>
The fact that event processing can take place within your application thread's call stack makes developing applications with Esper easier: Any common Java integrated development environment (IDE) can host an Esper engine instance. This allows developers to easily set up test cases, debug through listener code and inspect input or output events, or trace their call stack.
        </para>
        
		<para>
In the default configuration, each engine instance maintains a single timer thread (internal timer) providing for time or schedule-based processing within the engine. The default resolution at which the internal timer operates is 100 milliseconds. The internal timer thread can be disabled and applications can instead send external time events to an engine instance to perform timer or scheduled processing at the resolution required by an application.
        </para>
        
		<para>
Each engine instance performs minimal locking to enable high levels of concurrency. An engine instance locks on a statement level to protect statement resources.
        </para>

		<para>
For an engine instance to produce predictable results from the viewpoint of listeners to statements, an engine instance by default ensures that 
it dispatches statement result events to listeners in the order in which a statement produced result events. Applications that require the highest possible concurrency and do not require predictable order of delivery of events to listeners, this feature can be turned off via configuration.
        </para>

		<para>
In multithreaded environments, when one or more statements make result events available via the <literal>insert into</literal> clause to further statements, the engine preserves the order of events inserted into the generated insert-into stream, allowing statements that consume other statement's events to behave deterministic. This feature can also be turned off via configuration.
        </para>

		<para>
We generally recommended that listener implementations block minimally or do not block at all. By implementing listener code as non-blocking code execution threads can often achieve higher levels of concurrency.
        </para>

		<para>
We recommended that, when using a single listener or subscriber instance to receive output from multiple statements, that the listener or subscriber code is multithread-safe. If your application has shared state between
listener or subscriber instances then such shared state should be thread-safe. 
        </para>

				In the default configuration the same application thread that invokes any of the <literal>sendEvent</literal> methods will process the event fully and also deliver output events to listeners and subscribers. By default the single internal timer thread based on system time performs time-based processing and delivery of time-based results. 
			</para>

			<para>
				This default configuration reduces the processing overhead associated with thread context switching, is lightweight and fast and works well in many environments such as J2EE, server or client. Latency and throughput requirements are largely use case dependant, and Esper provides engine-level facilities for controlling concurrency that are described next.

			</para>

			<para>
				<emphasis>Route Execution Threading</emphasis> means that the thread sending in an event via any of the <literal>sendEvent</literal> methods only identifies and pre-processes an event, and a pool of engine-managed threads handles the actual processing of the event for each statement, pushing threading to the level of each statement for event-arrival-based execution.

			<para>
				The engine starts engine-managed threads as daemon threads when the engine instance is first obtained. The engine stops engine-managed threads when the engine instance is destroyed via the <literal>destroy</literal> method. When the engine is initialized via the <literal>initialize</literal> method the existing engine-managed threads are stopped and new threads are created. When shutting down your application, use the <literal>destroy</literal> method to stop engine-managed threads.

				Care should be taken to consider arrival rates and queue depth. Threading options utilize unbound queues or capacity-bound queues with blocking-put, depending on configuration, and may therefore introduce an overload or blocking situation to your application. You may use the service provider interface as outlined below to manage queue sizes, if required, and to help tune the engine to your application needs.
			</para>

        <para>
			There are two modes for an engine to keep track of time: The internal timer based on JVM system time (the default), and externally-controlled time giving your application full control over the concept of time within an engine or isolated runtime.
        </para>

        <para>
			An isolated runtime is an execution environment separate from the engine runtime, allowing full control over the concept of time for a group of statements, as further described in <xref linkend="api-isolatedruntime"/>.
        </para>

        <para>
			By default the internal timer provides time and evaluates schedules. External clocking can be used to supply time ticks to the engine instead. The latter is useful for testing time-based event sequences or for synchronizing the engine with an external time source.
        </para>

        <para>
			The internal timer relies on the <literal>java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor</literal> class for time tick events. The next section describes timer resolution for the internal timer, by default set to 100 milliseconds but is configurable via the threading options. When using externally-controlled time the timer resolution is in your control.
        </para>

        <para>
			To disable the internal timer and use externally-provided time instead, there are two options. The first option is to use the configuration API at engine initialization time. The second option toggles on and off the internal timer at runtime, via special timer control events that are sent into the engine like any other event.
        </para>

        <para>
			If using a timer execution thread pool as discussed above, the internal timer or external time event provide the schedule evaluation however do not actually perform the time-based processing. The time-based processing is performed by the threads in the timer execution thread pool.
        </para>

        <para>

        <para>
			After disabling the internal timer, it is wise to set a defined time so that any statements created thereafter start relative to the time defined. Use the <literal>CurrentTimeEvent</literal> class to indicate current time to the engine
			and to move time forward for the engine.
        </para>

        <para>

runtime.sendEvent(new TimerControlEvent(TimerControlEvent.ClockType.CLOCK_EXTERNAL));]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			Your application sends a <literal>CurrentTimeEvent</literal> event when it desires to move the time forward. All aspects of Esper engine time related to EPL statements and patterns are driven by the time provided by the <literal>CurrentTimeEvent</literal> that your application sends in.
		</para>

			When sending external timer events, your application should make sure that <literal>long</literal>-type time values are ascending. That is, each long-type value should be either the same value or a larger value then the prior value provided by a <literal>CurrentTimeEvent</literal>. The engine outputs a warning if time events move back in time.

        </para>
			
		<para>
			The internal timer thread can be configured to use nano-second time as returned by <literal>System.nanoTime()</literal>. If configured for nano-second time, the engine computes an offset of the nano-second ticks to wall clock time upon startup to present back an accurate millisecond wall clock time. 
			Please see section <xref linkend="config-engine-time-source"/> to configure the internal timer thread to use <literal>System.nanoTime()</literal>.

        </para>
			
        <para>
			Your application can achieve a higher tick rate then 1 tick per millisecond by sending external timer events that carry a long-value which is not based on milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT. In this case, your time interval parameters need to take consideration of the changed use of engine time. 
        </para>
			
        <para>
			Thus, if your external timer events send long values that represents microseconds (1E-6 sec), then your time window interval must be 1000-times larger, i.e. "win:time(1000)" becomes a 1-second time window.
        </para>
			        
        <para>
			And therefore, if your external timer events send long values that represents nanoseconds (1E-9 sec), then your time window interval must be 1000000-times larger, i.e. "win:time(1000000)" becomes a 1-second time window.

    <sect1 id="api-isolatedruntime">
        <title>Runtime Isolation</title>

		<para>
			Isolated service providers allow an application to control event visibility and the concept of time as desired on a statement level: Events sent into an isolated service are visible only to those statements that currently reside in the isolated service and are not visible to statements outside of that isolated service. Within an isolated service an application can control time independently, start time at a point in time and advance time at the resolution and pace suitable for the statements within that isolated service. 
		</para>

		<para>
			Your application can create new statements that start in an isolated runtime. You can also move existing statements to the engine to the isolated service. When done, you may move statements back from the isolated service into the engine.
		</para>

        <para>
			An isolated runtime is thus a separate execution environment that may hold one or more statements. Statements are moved into an isolated runtime to isolate the statement from engine runtime event and timer-based processing. Statements are returned to the engine runtime when statements should continue to receive incoming events and take part in time-based processing of the engine runtime.
        </para>

        <para>
			As discussed before, a single Java Virtual Machine may hold multiple Esper engine instances unique by engine URI, each with its own independent configuration. Within an Esper engine instance the default execution environment for statements is the <literal>EPRuntime</literal> engine runtime, which coordinates all statement's reaction to incoming events and to time passing (via internal or external timer).

        </para>

        <para>
			Metrics reporting is, by default, disabled. To enable reporting, please follow the steps as outlined in <xref linkend="config-engine-instrumentation"/>. Metrics reporting must be enabled at engine initialization time. Reporting intervals can be controlled at runtime via the <literal>ConfigurationOperations</literal> interface available from the administrative API.
        </para>

        <para>
			Your application receives metrics at configurable intervals via EPL statement. A metric datapoint is simply a well-defined event. The events are <literal>EngineMetric</literal> and <literal>StatementMetric</literal> and the Java class representing the events can be found in the client API in package <literal>com.espertech.esper.client.metric</literal>.
        </para>

        <para>
			Since metric events are processed by the engine the same as application events, your EPL may use any construct on such events. For example, your application may select, filter, aggregate properties, sort or insert into a stream or named window all metric events the same as application events.
        </para>

        </para>        

        <para>
			The engine provides metric events after the configured interval of time has passed. By default, only started statements that have activity within an interval (in the form of event or timer processing) are reported upon.
        </para>        

        <para>
			The default configuration performs the publishing of metric events in an Esper daemon thread under the control of the engine instance. Metrics reporting honors externally-supplied time, if using external timer events.

			Your application may use the built-in XML and JSON formatters to render output events into a readable textual format, such as for integration or debugging purposes. This section introduces the utility classes in the client <literal>util</literal> package for rendering events to strings. Further API information can be found in the JavaDocs.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>EventRenderer</literal> interface accessible from the runtime interface via the <literal>getEventRenderer</literal> method provides access to JSON and XML rendering. For repeated rendering of events of the same event type or subtypes, it is recommended to obtain a <literal>JSONEventRenderer</literal> or <literal>XMLEventRenderer</literal> instance and use the <literal>render</literal> method provided by the interface. This allows the renderer implementations to cache event type metadata for fast rendering.
		</para>

				The renderer does render indexed properties, it does not render indexed properties that require an index, i.e. if your event representation is backed by POJO objects and your getter method is <literal>getValue(int index)</literal>, the indexed property values are not part of the JSON text. This is because the implementation has no way to determine how many index keys there are. A workaround is to have a method such as <literal>Object[] getValue()</literal> instead.
			</para>

			<para>
				The same is true for mapped properties that the renderer also renders.  If a property requires a Map key for access, i.e. your getter method is <literal>getValue(String key)</literal>, such property values are not part of the result text as there is no way for the implementation to determine the key set.

				The renderer does render indexed properties, it does not render indexed properties that require an index, i.e. if your event representation is backed by POJO objects and your getter method is <literal>getValue(int index)</literal>, the indexed property values are not part of the XML text. This is because the implementation has no way to determine how many index keys there are. A workaround is to have a method such as <literal>Object[] getValue()</literal> instead.

				The same is true for mapped properties that the renderer also renders.  If a property requires a Map key for access, i.e. your getter method is <literal>getValue(String key)</literal>, such property values are not part of the result text as there is no way for the implementation to determine the key set.
