    * The Destroy() method has been changed to Dispose(). Of course this implies that the objects now implement IDisposable ... so if you have language bindings, now you can use them.
  
    * The statement listeners have been augmented by true EventHandlers (delegates). So you don't need to implement an interface and you don't need to use proxies from previous versions.

    * Full support for string indexing was added to NEsper (the Java version doesn't support this).
