DEBS 2011 Challenge - The Trivia Geeks Club game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Introduction

    The Distributed Event-Based Systems 2011 conference raised an interesting challenge, the {{{http://debs2011.fzi.de/index.php/challenge}Trivia Geeks Club: A Social Game}}.
    
    We implemented a solution to the challenge that is outlined here.
    
  	
* Problem

    There are three event producers:

    * Trivia question generator which generates the trivia question and emits an event with trivia question and answer, the question (without the correct answer of course) is sent to all subscribers;
    
    * Player which can generate events of three type: answer, answer annulment, and request for most frequent answer, in that case the system generates an answer to this request and sends it as an event to the player;
    
    * The system that generates control events that trigger the changes in some scoring rules.

	The event consumers are:

    * A scoreboard manager which displays points for all players on a scoreboard, the system sends each point increase/decrease event to that consumer;
    
    * A Player, getting response to a most frequent answer request.


	The system functions are:

    * Get new questions;
    
    * Get answers; Determine if the question is still valid, and if yes match against the answer, and create score event if applicable;
    
    * Enable annulment of answers.
    

	The scoring system creates score event with points for player according to the following scoring table:

*----------+----------------+
| Case | Score       |
*----------+----------------+
| Correct answer | 5 |
*-----+------+
| Correct answer after asking for the most frequent answer | 1 |
*-----+------+
| First who answered | 100 |
*-----+------+
| Incorrect answer | -1 |
*-----+------+
| Three answers incorrect without a correct answer in the middle | -50 |
*-----+------+
| Correct answers to 10 consecutive questions | 500 |
*-----+------+
| Correct answers to 10 questions within 30 minutes* during late night hours (1:00 – 5:00) | 500 |
*-----+------+



* Solution

     The solution in EPL is below. No user-defined function or other solution-specific Java code is needed.
