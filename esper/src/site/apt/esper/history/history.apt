Version 4.3.0

	Released July 18, 2011
	
	Built and tested with JDK 6.0 Update 26

* API changes

  * None.
    
* Major changes

  * We have made a change to NULL-value comparison, to closely follow SQL standards, as follows: In version 4.3, the expression "property = NULL" always returns null, use "property is NULL" instead. Version 4.2 and earlier returned true/false.
    For more information, please see http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/ESPER-569

  * Support for filter expressions as part of aggregation functions, for example "select count(*, color='black'), count(*) as percentBlack from Marbels"
  
  * Support for interval algebra methods, e.g. before, after, coincides, during, includes, meets etc.

  * Support for a new expression-driven data window "win:expr". Use for dynamically shrinking and expanding time or length windows, or for custom expiry logic based on work days, for example.
    
  * Support for specifying a consumption policy on pattern filters. Useful when a pattern references the same filter multiple times and the application requires a filter to consume or prioritize one filter over another.
  
  * Support for the transpose(...) function. For use in the select-clause to transpose an expression result object to a stream.
  
  * Support for {} array operator to provide input to enumeration methods.
  
  * Support for subqueries that return multiple result columns to be used in an expression definition.  
  
  * Support for @Audit to output nested expression results.
  
  * New example "Trivia Geeks Club".
  
  * Many bug fixes and improvements to documentation, code and performance; Please see history or changelog.txt for additional information.

Version 4.2.0

	Released April 19, 2011
	
	Built with JDK 6.0 Update 24

* API changes

  * None.
    
* Major changes
     
  * Support for enumeration methods, which work with lambda expressions to perform common tasks on subquery results, named windows, event properties or inputs that are or can be projected to a collection of events, scalar values or objects.
  
  * Support for date-time methods for date and time manipulation and querying, such as for adding or subtracting time periods, setting or rounding calendar fields and querying fields.
  
  * Support for @Audit annotation which instructs the engine to output detailed debug-level information about the statements processing, such as pattern instance counts, expression result values, property values and more.
  
  * Support for Virtual Data Window, an extension point for (large) external data stores to become accessible same as a named window.
  
  * Support for the 'new' operator, which populates a new data structure by evaluating column names and assignment expressions, useful when an expression should return multiple results, for performing a transformation or inside enumeration method lambda expressions.
  
  * Support for constructor injection for event objects populated by insert into.
  
  * Support for the on-merge clause to allow multiple actions (multiple then-clauses), to allow insert-into a stream other then the currently-merged named window and adding support for an optional where-clause for each action.
  
  * Support for mapped and indexed properties to allow an expression as a map key or index.
  
  * Support for expression declarations. Expressions that are common to multiple places in an EPL statement can be moved to a named expression declaration and reused within the statement without duplicating the expression itself.
  
  * Improvement for query planning and indexing for joins, subqueries, on-merge, on-select, on-update, on-delete, fire-and-forget queries and create-index to support btree indexes for use with ranges, inverted ranges and relational operator (\>, \<, \>=, \<=) queries. 
  
  * Improvements to statement metrics reporting in regards to event counts and reporting for named windows.
  
  * Improvements to query plan output.
  
  * Reduced memory use for hash indexes on single columns.

  * Support for subqueries against named windows to share existing indexes on the named window (both implicitly-created or via create-index)
  
  * Support for configuration option to enable output of query plan to log destination (aka. explain-plan)
  
  * Support for a new 'typeof' function that returns the event type name, for use with variant streams and event type super-types (POJO extends and implements, map super-types)
  
  * Support for XML event type update at runtime via ConfigurationOperations
  
  * Support for an extended time interval grammar that now supports 'weeks', 'months' and 'years' keywords
  
  * Support for additional means to control external time

Version 4.0.0

	Released September 27, 2010
	
	Built with JDK 6.0 Update 21

* API changes

  * None.
    
* Major changes
      
  * The following dependent jar files are upgraded:
  
  	* Required: ANTLR version upgrade from 3.1.1 to 3.2
  	
        * Optional: LOG4J upgrade from 1.2.15 to 1.2.16
       
  * The bound-repeat syntax in the repeat-until pattern operator changed syntax:
    The old syntax of separating range value by dots "[low .. high]" is no longer supported. Use the colon ":" character instead of "..", version 3.5 supported the same syntax.
    
  * The meaning of the index parameter to the "nth" aggregation function has changed:
    To be consistent with "prev" and "last" functions an index of zero now returns the current row. 
    For Example: "nth(value, 0)" returns the current row and "nth(value, 1)" returns the previous-row value.
    
  * The semantics for "output first" have changed: For statements that have a "group-by" clause the "output first" now outputs the first events per group.
  
  * The data window "std:groupby" for grouped data windows has been renamed to "std:groupwin" to avoid confusion with the group-by clause.

  * The "first" aggregation function has been renamed to "firstever".
  
  * The "last" aggregation function has been renamed to "lastever". This makes a difference as data window deletes are reflected by the new "last" aggregation function and are not reflected by "lastever".
  
  * Support for new aggregation functions that track the data window : "first", "last" and "window" with a convenient syntax for access to all attributes.
  
  * Support for new single-row functions for data window access: "prevtail", "prevwindow" and "prevcount".

  * Support for registering an exception handler that is called when any continuous-query statement exception occurs.
  
  * Support for all statistics views and the size view to accept additional expressions as parameters for returning values pertaining to the last-applied event.
  
  * Support for chained method invocations on events in streams, library static methods and single-row functions.
  
  * Support for registering single-row functions by function name.
  
  * Support for dot-syntax in the form of "(expression).method(...).method(...)" which includes support for duck typing, obtaining array size and calling get(index) on an array or collection.
  
  * Support for subqueries to select multiple columns.
  
  * Support for correlated aggregation in subqueries.
  
  * Support for selecting multiple columns in a subquery.
  
  * Support for contained-event syntax on events selected from a named window.
  
  * Support for expressions in the [] bound repeat in patterns.
  
  * Support for grouped data windows to remove groups that haven't changed for a given time period, as specified via hint.

  []
    
* Minor changes

  * To be congruent to the JDBC 4 specification, the SQL query metadata now uses the value returned by the JDBC driver result set metadata for "getColumnLabel" as the column name or if that is null the value returned by "getColumnName".
  
  * For plug-in aggregation functions, the parameter to the "validate" method has changed and is now a validation context that provides additional information. The "validateMultiParameter" method has been removed.
  
  * We added a new example demonstrating runtime configuration.
  
  * Bug fixes: see JIRA list of resolved issues for release 3.5 or changelog.txt

Version 3.2.0

	Released Sept. 6, 2009

Version 3.1.0

	Released May 16, 2009
	
	Built with Sun JDK 5.0 Update 16; Also tested for JDK 6 Update 10

* API changes

  * None.
    
* Major changes
  
  * The new "every-distinct" operator has been introduced to the pattern language. Very similar to the "every" operator, this operator
    suppresses duplicate results received from sub-expressions based on a set of expressions returning distinct-values. 

  * The EPL language now understands annotations following the annotation syntax standard.
    An annotation is an addition made to information in a statement. Esper provides certain built-in annotations for
    defining statement name (@Name), adding a statement description (@Description) or for tagging statements.
    Applications can provide their own annotation classes that the EPL compiler can populate.
    
  * The engine now provides a way to prioritize and preempt processing of an event when multiple statements must process the event,
    via the @Priority and @Drop annotations.
    
  * The insert-into clause can now directly populate an underlying event object from a select clause, i.e. populate your object or Map type.
  
  * We have extended the on-insert syntax by a new split-stream syntax. This allows to list multiple insert-into, select clauses and where-clauses
    thereby making it easy to split or duplicate an event stream into multiple further event streams.

  * The behavior of "timer:within" when used within an "every" in a pattern has changed slightly: The sub-expression qualified by "timer-within" upon expiry 
    of the timer now evaluates to permanently false, while previously it simple stopped. This allows the "every" operator to restart such sub-expression.
    For example, the expression:
      every(A -> (B where timer:within(5 sec)))
    ... When no B event arrives after an A event, the "every" restarts the subexpression looking for the next A followed by B within 5 sec.
    
  []
    
* Minor changes

  * The provider URI of the default engine instance is now "default" instead of null.
    This is for consistency with the default engine qualifier for optional use in stream and property name qualification, which is also "default".
    Therefore EPServiceProviderManager.getDefaultProvider().getURI() returns "default", and passing null to the EPServiceProviderManager still returns the default instance.

  * The PluginLoader interface for writing adapters has a new required method that must be implemented to allow plugins to initialize after complete Esper engine initialization.
    
  * Bug fixes: see JIRA list of resolved issues for release 3.1

Version 3.0.0

	Released February 11, 2009
	
	Built with Sun JDK 5.0 Update 16; Also tested for JDK 6 Update 10

* API changes

  * Please consult {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ESPER/Migrating+Esper+2.x+to+3.0}Migrating Esper 2.x to Esper 3}}
    for detailed information.

    The summary of changes are:
      
      * Upgraded version of dependent jar files 
      
      * Moved EventType, EventBean and related exception classes from package com.espertech.esper.event to com.espertech.esper.client
      
      * Several minor rename of methods in the Configuration API related to event type name retiring "alias" as a word in method names
      
      * EPL division expressions yield double-type results
      
      * EPL view and pattern parameters strongly distinquish between string constant and property name
      
      * EPL join statements for certain stream types now require a data window declaration
      
      * EPL when using multiple data windows defaults to intersection semantics
      
      * Extension API for views, pattern objects and event representations have additional or slighly changed signatures
      
      []
  []
    
* Major changes
    
  * The view parameters and pattern object parameters are now expressions. Thereby they gain certain new features: 
    
    * Variables may be used to parameterize views or pattern objects; 

    * Prepared statements may use substitution parameters to parameterize views and pattern objects;

    * Pattern objects may be parameterized by prior events;

    * The syntax for views namespace.name('property') is no longer supported.
    
    []

  * New syntax to support contained-event selection, for use with coarse-grained events that contain finer-grained events or rows.
      This allows convenient extraction and analysis of information from business-level composite events.    

  * Added XML and JSON renderers for output events

  * When using multiple data windows for the same stream in EPL, the default policy is intersection of data windows, and a union-policy is also available via keyword. 
      This allows concise declaration and combination of multiple expiry policies and well-defined semantics.

  * We have made substantial internal enhancements to the type system to simplify and support transposing from any type of stream to an event property in a further stream.

  * Enhanced the XML DOM event to support: The changes gained features to transposing XPath expression results between statements and including arrays,
      as well as transposing property expression results. The changes also correct a problem in which an expression "index[1]" accessed the firs element in a collection and not the second.

  * Added a new method for statements to add a listener with replay in one transaction, by name "addListenerWithReplay".

  * The EPL now returns a double-type result for division expressions where both operands to a division were non-FP types, such as "1/2", i.e. double 0.5. 
      This follows SQL standards and makes EPL easier to read and use. Esper 2.x returned an integer value following Java standards (i.e. zero).

  * The EPL does no longer assume keep-all semantics if no data window is specified for a filter-based or pattern-based stream in a join. 
      EPL now requires a data window to be explicitly defined to applicable streams.   

  * Added support for SQL-standard ANY, SOME and ALL keywords in group comparison.  

  * Added advanced threading options to configuration for use with inbound, outbound and execution threading at engine-level.  

  * Improved support for Java-object event representation with parameterized types (Java generics), List and Iterable properties.  

  * Added support for escaping property names and event type names in case an overlap occurs with keywords.

  * New configuration options to change the caching behavior for UDF invocations.
  
  []

* Minor changes	    	

  * Removed "stat:cube" view.

  * Removed "indicator.jmx" package.

  * Removed "emit" method from EPRuntime and EmittedListener.
    
  * Removed examples LinearRoad, RSI and ATM.

  * The Maven build no longer compiles the grammar. The grammar is now compiled via "esper/grammar/antlrtool.bat" or "antlrtool.sh". The resulting parser is
      part of the source code base.

  * Added new examples for named window and OHLC; We restructured the examples directory structure and added Eclipse projects.

  * Documentation and performance enhancements

  * Bug fixes: see JIRA list of resolved issues for release 3.0
