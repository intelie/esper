 * Annotation for use in EPL statements to suppress any statement-level locking (use with caution, see below).
 * <p>
 *     Caution: We provide this annotation for the purpose of identifing locking overhead,
 *     or when your application is single-threaded, or when using an external mechanism for concurreny control
 *     or for example with virtual data windows or plug-in data windows to allow customizing concurrency
 *     for application-provided data windows.
 *     Using this annotation may have unpredictable results unless your application is taking concurrency under consideration.
