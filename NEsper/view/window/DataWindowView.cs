	/// <summary> Tag interface for data window views. Data window views follow the view interface but keep a window over the
	/// data received by their parent view. Data window view may keep length windows or time windows or other windows.
	/// 
	/// Data window views generally follow the following behavior:
	/// They publish the data that was received as new data from their parent view directly as
	/// new data to child views.
	/// They publish the data that expires out of the window (for length or time reasons or other reasons) as old data to
	/// their child views.
	/// They remove the data they receive as old data from their parent view out of the window and report the data
	/// removed as old data to child views.
	/// 
	/// Certain views may decide to attach only to data window views directly. One reason for this is that
	/// window limit the number of event instances kept in a collection. Without this limitation some views may
	/// not work correctly over time as events accumulate but are not removed from the view by means old data updates
	/// received from a parent data window.
