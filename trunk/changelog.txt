Changes in version 1.0.5
------------------------------------

* (EQL) Added support for the "first" keyword in output rate limiting for outputting only the first matching event for an interval
* (EQL and Pattern) Added support for XML events represented by a document object model (DOM) instances of org.w3c.dom.Node
* (EQL and Pattern) Added support for Map events represented by a java.util.Map including object values
* (Docs and Examples) New AutoId RFID example for XML event processing, includes simulator for running from the command line 
* (Docs and Examples) New chapter on Event Representations

Changes in version 1.0.0
------------------------------------

* (EQL) Added support for invoking Java library static methods, invoking user-defined static methods, and defining an auto-import list
* (EQL) Sort view ext:sort now also allowing multiple columns to sort on
* (EQL) Added NOT, modulo (%) and SQL string concatention operator (||)
* (EQL) New example 'Market Feed Monitor' which showcases rate calculation and fall-off detection. With a simulator that 
can be run from command line. 
* (build) Build scripts now build Linux tarball; Shell scripts for compiling and running examples reworked.

Changes in version 0.9.5
------------------------------------

* (EQL) Capability added to sort output using an "order-by" clause
* (EQL) Support for bit-wise AND (&), OR (|) and XOR(^) operators
* (EQL) Bug fix for allowing boolean expression in select clauses, such as "select a and b from MyEvent..."
* (EQL) Added support for "insert into" thus allowing chains of EQL statements, and merging of event streams
* (Docs and Examples) New 10-minute tutorial; Transaction example simplified

Changes in version 0.9.1
------------------------------------

* (EQL) Bug fix for statements that contain only aggregation functions in the select clause such as 
"select sum(volume) from StockTick". The engine was incorrectly posting an event per event posted 
by the stream's window, rather then a single aggregate event.
* (EQL) Bug fix for group-by without output rate limiting. This problem occured using a group-by clause
without output rate limit and resulted in multiple events posted that include prior groups for each event posted 
by the window.
* (EQL) New example 'Transaction 3-event challenge' which shows EQL in use for detecting missing events and
computing latency totals overall and grouped. Added scripts for compiling and executing the example.

Changes in version 0.9.0
------------------------------------

* (EQL) Now supporting outer joins for an unlimited number of event streams
* (EQL) Support for output rate limiting based on number of events and time-based, and choice of last or all events
* (EQL) Renamed view "std:last" to "std:lastevent"
* (EQL) New reserved keywords: last, events, output, seconds, minutes

Changes in version 0.8.5
------------------------------------

* (EQL) Added support for the group-by clause and the having-clause
* (EQL) Added support for aggregation functions in the select and having-clauses; The list of aggregation functions is: 
max, min, sum, avg, count, median, stddev, avedev; The "distinct" keyword is also supported for each; The "count(*)" syntax is supported.
* (EQL) Group-by view has been renamed from "std:group" to "std:groupby" since group is a reserved keyword
* (EQL) The univariate statistics view "stat:uni" changed the name of derived event properties to "stddev" and "stddevpa" from formerly 
"stdev" and "stdevpa" to stay consistent with the aggregate functions of the same name


Changes in version 0.8.0
------------------------------------

* (EQL and Event Pattern) Event inheritance and interface implementation support; Added support for interfaces, 
abstract classes, superclasses. E.g. select * from IMyEvent  (where IMyEvent) is an interface or superclass, and event classes that 
implement this interface or extend the superclass match the criteria.
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Added support for simple, mapped, indexed, nested and any combination of these anywhere where
and event property name is expected. E.g. subordinate[3].address(home).city
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Refined exception texts to better indicate syntax errors or messages in validating pattern and EQL statements
during statement creation. Added EPStatementSyntaxException and EPStatementException.


Changes in version 0.7.5
------------------------------------

* (API) A configuration can now optionally be supplied to an engine instance via the Configuration parameter to EPServiceProviderManager.
This enabled event patterns and EQL to use short event names not requiring making the fully-qualified Java class name optional
* (EQL) Outer joins: left, right and full join on 2 streams
* (EQL) IS NULL, = NULL, IS NOT NULL, <> and != now supported in where clause
* (EQL) New built-in function MAX(a, b,...), MIN(a, b,...)
* (Event Pattern) Use of results in filters, such as "every A=X -> every B=X(objectID=A.objectID)"
* (Event Pattern) improved removal of permanently false patterns (e.g. B arrives in 'A and not B')
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Removed requirement that event names have () postfix, e.g. 'every A=X' equivalent to 'every A=X()'
* (Documentation) new section on builtin functions
* (Examples) Sample ATM added to show simple join
