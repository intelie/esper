"select sum(volume) from StockTick". The engine was incorrectly posting an event per event posted 
by the stream's window, rather then a single aggregate event.
* (EQL) Bug fix for group-by without output rate limiting. This problem occured using a group-by clause
without output rate limit and resulted in multiple events posted that include prior groups for each event posted 
by the window.
* (EQL) New example 'Transaction 3-event challenge' which shows EQL in use for detecting missing events and
computing latency totals overall and grouped. Added scripts for compiling and executing the example.

max, min, sum, avg, count, median, stddev, avedev; The "distinct" keyword is also supported for each; The "count(*)" syntax is supported.
* (EQL) Group-by view has been renamed from "std:group" to "std:groupby" since group is a reserved keyword
* (EQL) The univariate statistics view "stat:uni" changed the name of derived event properties to "stddev" and "stddevpa" from formerly 
"stdev" and "stdevpa" to stay consistent with the aggregate functions of the same name


Changes in version 0.8.0
------------------------
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Event inheritance and interface implementation support; Added support for interfaces, 
abstract classes, superclasses. E.g. select * from IMyEvent  (where IMyEvent) is an interface or superclass, and event classes that 
implement this interface or extend the superclass match the criteria.
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Added support for simple, mapped, indexed, nested and any combination of these anywhere where
and event property name is expected. E.g. subordinate[3].address(home).city
* (EQL and Event Pattern) Refined exception texts to better indicate syntax errors or messages in validating pattern and EQL statements
during statement creation. Added EPStatementSyntaxException and EPStatementException.


Changes in version 0.7.5

* (API) A configuration can now optionally be supplied to an engine instance via the Configuration parameter to EPServiceProviderManager.
This enabled event patterns and EQL to use short event names not requiring making the fully-qualified Java class name optional

* (EQL) IS NULL, = NULL, IS NOT NULL, <> and != now supported in where clause

* (Documentation) new section on builtin functions
* (Examples) Sample ATM added to show simple join
