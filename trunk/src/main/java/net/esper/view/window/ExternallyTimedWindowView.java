/**
 * View for a moving window extending the specified amount of time into the past, driven entirely by external timing
 * supplied within long-type timestamp values in a field of the event beans that the view receives.
 *
 * The view is completely driven by timestamp values that are supplied by the events it receives,
 * and does not use the system time.
 * It requires a field name as parameter for a field that returns ascending long-type timestamp values.
 * It also requires a long-type parameter setting the time length in milliseconds of the time window.
 * Events are expected to provide long-type timestamp values in natural order. The view does
 * itself not use the current system time for keeping track of the time window, but just the
 * timestamp values supplied by the events sent in.
 *
 * The arrival of new events with a newer timestamp then past events causes the window to be re-evaluated and the oldest
 * events pushed out of the window. Ie. Assume event X1 with timestamp T1 is in the window.
 * When event Xn with timestamp Tn arrives, and the window time length in milliseconds is t, then if
 * ((Tn - T1) > t == true) then event X1 is pushed as oldData out of the window. It is assumed that
 * events are sent in in their natural order and the timestamp values are ascending.
