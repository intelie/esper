			Indicators are pluggable modules that communicate the results of event stream processing to the external world. 
			Indicators can act as visualizers that present a graphical view of their event inputs. They can also be warning agents
			(monitors) that send alerts, warnings or other control events to the outside world. 
		</para>
		
		<para>
			In their implementation indicators can be classes that implement the <literal>UpdateListener</literal> interface and that can thus
			be attached directly to one or more statements. Indicactors can also be attached to one or more <literal>EPStatement</literal> instances.
			This makes is possible for indicators to merge data as well as pull data from trigger and statement views.
		</para>

		<para>
			Indicators may be integration components that plug together with other software, an some indicators will be supplied by Esper.
			Esper currently only has one indicator module as described below.
