        <para>
			An event is an immutable record of a past occurrence of an action or state change. Event properties capture the state information for an event.
			An event is represented by either a POJO (plain-old Java object), a <literal>java.util.Map</literal> or a XML document via <literal>org.w3c.dom.Node</literal>.
        </para>

        <para>
			In Esper, an event can be represented by any of the following underlying Java objects:

			 Event properties capture the state information for an event. Event properties be simple as well as indexed, mapped and nested event properties. The table below outlines the different types of properties and their syntax in an event expression. This syntax allows statements to query deep JavaBean objects graphs, XML structures and Map events.

		<para>
			If your application uses <literal>java.util.Map</literal> or XML to represent events, then event property names may themselves contain the dot ('.') character. The backslash ('\') character can be used to escape dot characters in property names, allowing a property name to contain dot characters.

			Dynamic (unchecked) properties are event properties that need not be known at statement compilation time. Such properties are resolved during runtime.
		</para>
			
		<para>
			The idea behind dynamic properties is that for a given underlying event representation we don't always know all properties in advance. An underlying event may have additional properties that are not known at statement compilation time, that we want to query on. The concept is especially useful for events that represent rich, object-oriented domain models.
		</para>

		<para>
			The syntax of dynamic properties consists of the property name and a question mark. Indexed, mapped and nested properties can also be dynamic properties:

		<para>
			 Dynamic properties always return the <literal>java.lang.Object</literal> type. Also, dynamic properties return a <literal>null</literal> value if the dynamic property does not exist on events processed at runtime. 
		</para>

		<para>
			As an example, consider an OrderEvent event that provides an "item" property. The "item" property is of type <literal>Object</literal> and holds a reference to an instance of either a Service or Product. 
		</para>

		<para>
			Assume that both Service and Product classes provide a property named "price". Via a dynamic property we can specify a query that obtains the price property from either object (Service or Product):
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select item.price? from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>		

		<para>
			 As a second example, assume that the Service class contains a "serviceName" property that the Product class does not possess. The following query returns the value of the "serviceName" property for Service objects. It returns a <literal>null</literal>-value for Product objects that do not have the "serviceName" property:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select item.serviceName? from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>		

		<para>
			Consider the case where OrderEvent has multiple implementation classes, some of which have a "timestamp" property. The next query returns the timestamp property of those implementations of the OrderEvent interface that feature the property:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select timestamp? from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>		
		
		<para>
			The query as above returns a single column named "timestamp?" of type <literal>Object</literal>. 			
		</para>

		<para>
			When dynamic properties are nested, then all properties under the dynamic property are also considered dynamic properties. In the below example the query asks for the "direction" property of the object returned by the "detail" dynamic property:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select detail?.direction from OrderEvent
// equivalent to 
select detail?.direction? from OrderEvent]]></programlisting>		

		<para>
			The functions that are often useful in conjunction with dynamic properties are:
		</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
                    The <literal>cast</literal> function casts the value of a dynamic property (or the value of an expression) to a given type.
                </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
                    The <literal>exists</literal> function checks whether a dynamic property exists. It returns <literal>true</literal> if the event has a property of that name, or false if the property does not exist on that event.
                </para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
                    The <literal>instanceof</literal> function checks whether the value of a dynamic property (or the value of an expression) is of any of the given types.

	   <title>Plain-Old Java Object Events</title>

		<indexterm><primary>event</primary><secondary>Java object</secondary></indexterm>
		<para>
			Plain-old Java object events are object instances that expose event properties through JavaBeans-style getter methods. Events classes or interfaces do not have to be fully compliant to the JavaBean specification; however for the Esper engine to obtain event properties, the required JavaBean getter methods must be present.
		</para>

		<para>
			Esper supports JavaBeans-style event classes that extend a superclass or implement one or more interfaces. Also, Esper event pattern and EPL statements can refer to Java interface classes and abstract classes. 
		</para>

		<para>
			Classes that represent events should be made immutable. As events are recordings of a state change or action that occurred in the past, the relevant event properties should not be changeable. However this is not a hard requirement and the Esper engine accepts events that are mutable as well.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>hashCode</literal> and <literal>equals</literal> methods do not need to be implemented. The implementation of these methods by a Java event class does not affect the behavior of the engine in any way.
		</para>

		<para>
			Please see <xref linkend="configuration"/> on options for naming event types represented by Java object event classes.

			<para>
				As outlined earlier, the different property types are supported by the standard JavaBeans specification, and some of which are uniquely supported by Esper:
			</para>

			<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis>Simple</emphasis> properties have a single value that may be retrieved. The underlying property type might be a Java language primitive (such as int, a simple object (such as a java.lang.String), or a more complex object whose class is defined either by the Java language, by the application, or by a class library included with the application.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis>Indexed</emphasis> - An indexed property stores an ordered collection of objects (all of the same type) that can be individually accessed by an integer-valued, non-negative index (or subscript). Alternatively, the entire set of values may be retrieved using an array. 
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis>Mapped</emphasis> - As an extension to standard JavaBeans APIs, Esper considers any property that accepts a String-valued key a mapped property. 
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<emphasis>Nested</emphasis> - A nested property is a property that lives within another Java object which itself is a property of an event. 
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		
			<para>
				Assume there is an EmployeeEvent event class as shown below. The mapped and indexed properties in this example return Java objects but could also return Java language primitive types (such as int or String). The Address object and Employee objects can themselves have properties that are nested within them, such as a streetName in the Address object or a name of the employee in the Employee object.
			</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[public class EmployeeEvent {
	public String getFirstName();
	public Address getAddress(String type);
	public Employee getSubordinate(int index);
	public Employee[] getAllSubordinates();
}
]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				<emphasis>Simple</emphasis> event properties require a getter-method that returns the property value. In this example, the <literal>getFirstName</literal> getter method returns the <literal>firstName</literal> event property of type String.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				<emphasis>Indexed</emphasis> event properties require either one of the following getter-methods. A method that takes an integer-type key value and returns the property value, such as the <literal>getSubordinate</literal> method. Or a method that returns an array-type such as the <literal>getSubordinates</literal> getter method, which returns an array of Employee. In an EPL or event pattern statement, indexed properties are accessed via the <literal>property[index]</literal> syntax.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				<emphasis>Mapped</emphasis> event properties require a getter-method that takes a String-typed key value and returns the property value, such as the <literal>getAddress</literal> method. In an EPL or event pattern statement, mapped properties are accessed via the <literal>property('key')</literal> syntax.
			</para>
	
			<para>
				<emphasis>Nested</emphasis> event properties require a getter-method that returns the nesting object. The <literal>getAddress</literal> and <literal>getSubordinate</literal> methods are mapped and indexed properties that return a nesting object. In an EPL or event pattern statement, nested properties are accessed via the <literal>property.nestedProperty</literal> syntax.
			</para>

			<para>
				All event pattern and EPL statements allow the use of indexed, mapped and nested properties (or a combination of these) anywhere where one or more event property names are expected. The below example shows different combinations of indexed, mapped and nested properties in filters of event pattern expressions:
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[every EmployeeEvent(firstName='myName')
every EmployeeEvent(address('home').streetName='Park Avenue')
every EmployeeEvent(subordinate[0].name='anotherName')
every EmployeeEvent(allSubordinates[1].name='thatName')
every EmployeeEvent(subordinate[0].address('home').streetName='Water Street')
]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Similarly, the syntax can be used in EPL statements in all places where an event property name is expected, such as in select lists, where-clauses or join criteria.
			</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select firstName, address('work'), subordinate[0].name, subordinate[1].name
from EmployeeEvent
where address('work').streetName = 'Park Ave'
]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Property names follows Java standards: the class <literal>java.beans.Introspector</literal> and method <literal>getBeanInfo</literal> returns the property names as derived from the name of getter methods. In addition, Esper configuration provides a flag to turn off case-sensitive property names. A sample list of getter methods and property names is:

			Constants are public static final fields in Java that may also participate in expressions of all kinds, as this example shows:

		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MyEvent where property=MyConstantClass.FIELD_VALUE]]></programlisting>

			Alternatively, a static method may be employed on a class, such as the enumeration class 'EnumClass' as below:
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from MyEvent where enumProp=EnumClass.valueOf('ENUM_VALUE_1')]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			Instance methods may also be invoked on event instances by specifying a stream name, as shown below:

			Java classes that do not follow JavaBean conventions, such as legacy Java classes that expose public fields, or methods not following naming conventions, require additional configuration. Via configuration it is also possible to control case sensitivity in property name resolution. The relevant section in the chapter on configuration is <xref linkend="config-java-legacy"/>.

			Events can also be represented by objects that implement the <literal>java.util.Map</literal> interface. 
			Event properties of <literal>Map</literal> events are the values in the map accessible through the <literal>get</literal> method exposed by the <literal>java.util.Map</literal> interface.
		</para>

		<para>
			The engine can process <literal>java.util.Map</literal> events via the <literal>sendEvent(Map map, String eventTypeAlias)</literal> method on the <literal>EPRuntime</literal> interface. Entries in the Map represent event properties. Keys must be of type <literal>java.util.String</literal> for the engine to be able to look up event property names specified by pattern or EPL statements. 
		</para>
			
		<para>
			Map event properties can be of any type. Map event properties that are Java application objects or that are of type <literal>java.util.Map</literal> offer additional power:
		</para>

			<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Properties that are Java application objects can be queried via the nested, indexed, mapped and dynamic property syntax as outlined earlier. 
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Properties that are of type <literal>Map</literal> allow Maps to be nested arbitrarily deep and thus can be used to represent complex domain information. The nested, indexed, mapped and dynamic property syntax can be used to query Maps within Maps.. 					
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

		<para>
			In order to use <literal>Map</literal> events, the event type name and property names and types must be made known to the engine via Configuration. Please see the examples in <xref linkend="config-java-util-map"/>.
		</para>
	   									
		<para>
			The code snippet below creates and processes a <literal>Map</literal> event. The example assumes the <literal>CarLocationUpdateEvent</literal> event type alias has been configured.
		</para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[Map event = new HashMap();
event.put("carId", carId);
event.put("direction", direction);
epRuntime.sendEvent(event, "CarLocUpdateEvent");]]></programlisting>
	
		<para>
			The <literal>CarLocUpdateEvent</literal> can now be used in a statement:
		</para>
		<programlisting>select carId from CarLocUpdateEvent.win:time(1 min) where direction = 1</programlisting> 
		
		<para>
			The engine can also query Java objects as values in a <literal>Map</literal> event via the nested property syntax. Thus <literal>Map</literal> events can be used to 
			aggregate multiple data structures into a single event and query the composite information in a convenient way. The example below demonstrates a <literal>Map</literal> event with a transaction and an account object.
		</para>
		<programlisting><![CDATA[Map event = new HashMap();
event.put("txn", txn);
event.put("account", account);
epRuntime.sendEvent(event, "TxnEvent");]]></programlisting>

			   For demonstration, in this example our top-level event type is an AccountUpdate event, which has an UpdatedField structure as a property. Inside the UpdatedField structure the example defines various fields, as well as a property by name 'history' that holds a JavaBean class 'UpdateHistory' to represent the update history for the account. The code snippet to define the event type is thus:
		   </para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[Map<String, Object> updatedFieldDef = new HashMap<String, Object>();
updatedFieldDef.put("name", String.class);
updatedFieldDef.put("addressLine1", String.class);
updatedFieldDef.put("history", UpdateHistory.class);

Map<String, Object> accountUpdateDef = new HashMap<String, Object>();
accountUpdateDef.put("accountId", long.class);
accountUpdateDef.put("fields", updatedFieldDef);

epService.getEPAdministrator().getConfiguration().
    addNestableEventTypeAlias("AccountUpdate", accountUpdateDef);]]></programlisting>

		   <para>
			   The next code snippet populates a sample event and sends the event into the engine:
		   </para>

		<programlisting><![CDATA[Map<String, Object> updatedField = new HashMap<String, Object>();
updatedField.put("name", "Joe Doe");
updatedField.put("addressLine1", "40 Popular Street");
updatedField.put("history", new UpdateHistory());

Map<String, Object> accountUpdate = new HashMap<String, Object>();
accountUpdate.put("accountId", 10009901);
accountUpdate.put("fields", updatedField);

epService.getEPRuntime().sendEvent(accountUpdate, "AccountUpdate");]]></programlisting>

		   <para>
			   Last, a sample query to interrogate AccountUpdate events is as follows:
		   </para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[select accountId, fields.name, fields.addressLine1, fields.history.lastUpdate
from AccountUpdate]]></programlisting>

			<para>
				Note that type information for nested maps is only available to the immediately selecting stream. For example, the second select-query does not work:
			</para>			
			<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into MyStream select fields from NestedMapEvent
// this does not work ... instead select the individual fields in the insert-into statement
select fields.name from MyStream ]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			Events can also be represented as <literal>org.w3c.dom.Node</literal> instances and send into the engine via the <literal>sendEvent</literal> method on <literal>EPRuntime</literal>. Please note that configuration is required for allowing the engine to map the event type alias to <literal>Node</literal> element names. See <xref linkend="configuration"/>.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			Esper allows configuring XPath expressions as event properties. You can specify arbitrary XPath functions or expressions and provide a property name by which their result values will be available for use in expressions. For XML documents that follow an XML schema, Esper can load and interrogate your schema and validate event property names and types against the schema information. 
		</para>
			
		<para>
			Nested, mapped and indexed event properties are also supported in expressions against <literal>org.w3c.dom.Node</literal> events. Thus XML trees can conveniently be
			interrogated using the existing event property syntax for querying JavaBean objects, JavaBean object graphs or <literal>java.util.Map</literal> events.

		<para>
		    Part of the extension and plug-in features of Esper is an event representation API. This set of classes allow an application to create new event types and event instances based on information available elsewhere, statically or dynamically at runtime when EPL statements are created. Please see <xref linkend="custom-event-representation"/> for details.
		</para>
		    
		<para>
			Creating a plug-in event representation can be useful when your application has existing Java classes that carry event metadata and event property values and your application does not want to (or cannot) extract or transform
such event metadata and event data into one of the built-in event representations (POJO Java objects, Map or XML DOM).
		</para>

		<para>
			Further use of a plug-in event representation is to provide a faster or short-cut access path to event data. For example, access to event data stored in an XML format through the Streaming API for XML (StAX) is known to be very efficient. A plug-in event representation can also provide network lookup and dynamic resolution of event type and dynamic sourcing of event instances.
		</para>

        <para>
			To summarize, an event is an immutable record of a past occurrence of an action or state change, and event properties contain useful information about an event.
        </para>

        <para>
			The length of time an event is of interest to the event processing engine (retention time) depends on your EPL statements, and especially the data window, pattern and output rate 
			limiting clauses of your statements.
        </para>

        <para>
			During the retention time of an event more information about the event may become available, such as additional properties or changes to existing properties. 
			Esper provides the concept of revision event type to handle such situations. A revision event type instructs the engine that new versions of an existing event are to be processed that update, amend or add to an existing event.
        </para>
        
        <para>
			Revision event types work together with the named window feature of the engine: A named window provides an explicit expiration policy for event instances that can be updated,
			thereby allowing the engine to retain only those versions that are relevant to any retained event and discarding updates to events not retained.
        </para>

		<para>
			Please see <xref linkend="named_update"/> for further instructions and examples.
		</para>

		<para>
			Note that patterns do not reflect changes to past events. For the temporal nature of patterns, any changes to events that were observed in the past do not reflect upon current pattern state.
