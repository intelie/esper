        <para>
            This chapter outlines the views that are built into Esper. All views can be arbitrarily combined as many of the examples below show. 
			The section on <xref linkend="processingmodel"/> provides additional information on the relationship of views, filtering and aggregation. Please also see <xref linkend="epl-from-clause-view-spec"/> for the use of views in the <literal>from</literal> clause with streams, patterns and named windows.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Esper organizes built-in views in namespaces and names. Views that provide sliding or tumbling data windows are in the <literal>win</literal> namespace. Other most commonly used views are in the <literal>std</literal> namespace. The <literal>ext</literal> namespace are views that order events. The <literal>stat</literal> namespace is used for views that derive statistical data.
        </para>

        <para>
            Esper distinguishes between data window views and derived-value views. Data windows, or data window views, are views that retain incoming events until an expiry policy indicates to release events. Derived-value views derive a new value from event streams and post the result as events of a new type.
        </para>
                
        <para>
			The keep-all data window counts as a data window but has no expiry policy: it retains all events received. The group-by data window allocates a new data window per group and thereby counts as a data window, but cannot appear alone.
        </para>

        <para>
            The next table summarizes data window views:

				<para>
					Similar to the time window, this view is a moving (sliding) time window extending the specified time interval into the past, but based on the millisecond
					time value supplied by an event property. The view takes two parameters: the name of the event property to return the long-typed timestamp value,
					and a time period or a number of seconds:
				</para>

				<synopsis>win:ext_timed(<emphasis>timestamp_property_name</emphasis>, <emphasis>time_period</emphasis>)</synopsis>
				<synopsis>win:ext_timed(<emphasis>timestamp_property_name</emphasis>, <emphasis>number_of_seconds</emphasis>)</synopsis>

				<para>
					The key difference comparing the externally-timed window to the regular time window is that the window slides not based on the engine time, but strictly based on the timestamp property value of the events entering the window.
					The algorithm underlying the view compares the timestamp value of the oldest event with the timestamp value of the newest arriving event on event arrival. If the time interval between the
					oldest and newest event is larger then the timer period parameter, then the algorithm removes all oldest events tail-first until the difference between the oldest and newest event is within the time interval. The window
					therefore slides only when events arrive and only considers each event's timestamp property and not engine time.
				</para>

				<para>
					This view holds stock tick events of the last 10 seconds based on the timestamp property in <literal>StockTickEvent</literal>.

				<para>
					The time batch window takes a second, optional parameter that serves as a reference point to batch flush times. If not specified, the arrival of the first event into the batch window sets the 
					reference point. Therefore if the reference point is not specified and the first event arrives at time t<subscript>1</subscript>, then the batch flushes at time t<subscript>1</subscript> plus <emphasis>time_period</emphasis> and every <emphasis>time_period</emphasis> thereafter.
				</para>

					The below example batches events into a 5 second window releasing new batches every 5 seconds. Listeners to updates
					posted by this view receive updated information only every 5 seconds.

				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent.win:time_batch(5 sec)]]></programlisting>
				
				<para>
					By default, if there are no events arriving in the current interval (insert stream), and no events remain from the prior batch (remove stream), then the view does not post results to listeners. The view allows overriding this
					default behavior via flow control keywords.
				</para>

				<para>
					The synopsis with flow control parameters is:
				</para>
				<synopsis>win:time_batch(<emphasis>time_period or num seconds</emphasis> [,<emphasis>optional_reference_point</emphasis>] 
    [, "flow-control-keyword [, keyword...]"] )</synopsis>

				<para>
					The FORCE_UPDATE flow control keyword instructs the view to post an empty result set to listeners if there is no
					data to post for an interval. When using this keyword the <literal>irstream</literal> keyword should be used in the <literal>select</literal> clause to ensure the remove stream is also output. 
				</para>
				
				<para>
					The START_EAGER flow control keyword instructs the view to post empty result sets even before the first event
					arrives, starting a time interval at statement creation time. As when using FORCE_UPDATE, the view also posts an
					empty result set to listeners if there is no data to post for an interval, however it starts doing so at time of statement
					creation rather then at the time of arrival of the first event.
				</para>

				<para>
					Taking the two flow control keywords in one sample statement, this example presents a view that waits for 10
					seconds. It posts empty result sets after one interval after the statement is created, and keeps posting an empty result set as no events arrive during intervals:

				<para>
					This data window view is a combination of time and length batch (tumbling) windows. Similar to the time and length batch windows, this view batches events and releases the batched events when either one of the 
following conditions occurs, whichever occurs first: the data window has collected a given number of events, or a given time interval has passed.
				</para>

				<para>
					The view parameters take 2 forms. The first form accepts a time period or number of seconds, and a parameter for the number of events:
				</para>				
				<synopsis>win:time_length_batch(<emphasis>time_period or number_of_seconds</emphasis>, <emphasis>number of events</emphasis>)</synopsis>

				<para>
					The next example shows a time-length combination batch window that batches up to 100 events or all events arriving within a 1-second time interval, whichever condition occurs first:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[ select * from MyEvent.win:time_length_batch(1 sec, 100)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					In this example, if 100 events arrive into the window before a 1-second time interval passes, the view posts the batch of 100 events. If less then 100 events arrive within a 1-second interval,
					the view posts all events that arrived within the 1-second interval at the end of the interval.
				</para>

				<para>
					By default, if there are no events arriving in the current interval (insert stream), and no events remain from the prior batch (remove stream), then the view does not post results to listeners. This
					view allows overriding this default behavior via flow control keywords.
				</para>

				<para>
					The synopsis of the view with flow control parameters is:
				</para>				
				<synopsis>win:time_length_batch(<emphasis>time_period or number_of_seconds</emphasis>, <emphasis>number of events</emphasis>, 
    "<emphasis>flow control keyword [, keyword...]</emphasis>")</synopsis>

				<para>
					The <literal>FORCE_UPDATE</literal> flow control keyword instructs the view to post an empty result set to listeners if there is no data to post for an interval. The view begins posting no later then after one time interval passed after the first event arrives. When using this keyword the <literal>irstream</literal> keyword should be used in the <literal>select</literal> clause to ensure the remove stream is also output. 
				</para>				

				<para>
					The <literal>START_EAGER</literal> flow control keyword instructs the view to post empty result sets even before the first event arrives, starting a time interval at statement creation time. As when using <literal>FORCE_UPDATE</literal>, the view also posts an empty result set to listeners if there is no data to post for an interval, however it starts doing so at time of statement creation rather then at the time of arrival of the first event.
				</para>				

				<para>
					Taking the two flow control keywords in one sample statement, this example presents a view that waits for 10 seconds or reacts when the 5th event arrives, whichever comes first. It posts empty result sets after one interval after the statement is created, and keeps posting an empty result set as no events arrive during intervals:

					This data window view is a specialized moving (sliding) time window that differs from the regular time window in that it accumulates events until no more events arrive within a given time interval, and only then releases the accumulated events as a remove stream.
				</para>

				<para>
					The view accepts a single parameter: the time period or number of seconds specifying the length of the time interval during which no events must arrive until the view releases accumulated events. The synopsis is as follows:
				</para>				
				<synopsis>win:time_accum(<emphasis>time_period or number_of_seconds</emphasis>)</synopsis>

				<para>
					The next example shows a time-accumulating window that accumulates events, and then releases events if within the time interval no more events arrive:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[ select * from MyEvent.win:time_accum(10 sec)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					This example accumulates events, until when for a period of 10 seconds no more MyEvent events arrive, at which time it posts all accumulated MyEvent events.
				</para>

				<para>
					Your application may only be interested in the batches of events as events leave the data window. This can be done simply by selecting the remove stream of this data window, populated by the engine as accumulated events leave the data window all-at-once when no events arrive during the time interval following the time the last event arrived:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[ select rstream * from MyEvent.win:time_accum(10 sec)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					This view groups events into sub-views by the value of the specified field or combination of fields. The view takes a single property name to supply the group-by values, or a list of property names as the synopsis shows:
				</para>

				<synopsis>std:groupby(<emphasis>property_name</emphasis> [, <emphasis>property_name</emphasis> ...])</synopsis>

				<para>

				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent.std:groupby(symbol).stat:uni(price)]]></programlisting>

				</para>
	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent.std:groupby(symbol, feed).stat:uni(price)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					The order in which the group-by view appears within sub-views of a stream controls the data the engine derives from events for each group. The next 2 statements demonstrate this using a length window.
				</para>

				<para>
					This example keeps a length window of 10 events of stock trade events, with a separate length window for each symbol. The engine calculates statistics on price for the last 10 events for each symbol. During runtime, the engine actually allocates a separate length window for each new symbol arriving.
				</para>
	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent.std:groupby(symbol).win:length(10).stat:uni(price)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					By putting the group-by view in position after the length window, we can change the semantics of the query. The query now returns the statistics on price per symbol for only the last 10 events across all symbols. Here the engine allocates only one length window for all events.
				</para>
	
				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent.win:length(10).std:groupby(symbol).stat:uni(price)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					We have learned that by placing the group-by view before other views, these other views become part of the grouped set of views. The engine dynamically allocates a new view instance for each subview, every time it encounters a new group key such as a new value for symbol. Therefore, in <literal>std:groupby(symbol).win:length(10)</literal> the engine allocates a new length window for each distinct symbol. However in <literal>win:length(10).std:groupby(symbol)</literal> the engine maintains a single length window.
				</para>

				<para>
					Multiple group-by views can also be used in the same statement. The statement below groups by symbol and feed. As the statement declares the time window after the group-by view for symbols, the engine allocates a new time window per symbol however reports statistics on price per symbol and feed. The query results are statistics on price per symbol and feed for the last 1 minute of events per symbol (and not per feed).
				</para>

				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent.std:groupby(symbol).win:time(1 minute)
    .std:groupby(feed).stat:uni(price)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					Last, we consider the permutation where the time window is declared after the group-by. Here, the query results are statistics on price per symbol and feed for the last 1 minute of events per symbol and feed.
				</para>

				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from StockTickEvent.std:groupby(symbol, feed)
    .win:time(1 minute).stat:uni(price)]]></programlisting>
    
				<para>
					For advanced users: There is an optional view that can control how the group-by view gets evaluated and that view is the <literal>std:merge</literal> view. 
					The merge view can only occur after a group-by view in a view chain and controls
					at what point in the view chain the merge of the data stream occurs from view-instance-per-criteria to single view.
				</para>

				<para>
					Compare the following statements:

				<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from Market.std:groupby(ticker).win:length(1000000)

select * from Market.std:groupby(ticker).win:length(1000000).std:merge(ticker)
    .stat:weighted_avg(price, volume)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					If your statement does not specify the optional <literal>std:merge</literal> view, the semantics are the same as the first statement.
				</para>

				<para>
					The first statement, in which the merge-view is added to the end (same as no merge view), computes weighted average per ticker, considering, per-ticker, the last 1M Market events for each ticker.
					The second statement, in which the merge view is added to the middle, computes weighted average considering, per-ticker, the last 1M Market events, computing the weighted average for all such events using a single view rather then multiple view instances with one view per ticker.

					This view orders events that arrive out-of-order, using a timestamp-property supplied by each event to be ordered, and by comparing the event timestamp to engine system time.

				<para>
					The syntax for this view is as follows.
				</para>
				<synopsis>ext:time_order(<emphasis>timestamp_property_name</emphasis>, <emphasis>time_period or number_of_seconds</emphasis>)</synopsis>

				<para>
					The first parameter to the view is the name of the property on the event that supplies the timestamp value. The timestamp is expected to be a long-typed millisecond value that denotes an event's time of consideration by the view. This is typically the time of arrival. The second parameter is a number of seconds or the time period specifying the time interval that an arriving event should maximally be held, in order to consider older events arriving at a later time.
				</para>

				<para>
					Since the view compares an event's timestamp property to engine time, the view requires that the event timestamp values and current engine time are both following the same clock. Therefore, to the extend that the clocks that originated both timestamps differ, the view may produce inaccurate results.
				</para>

				<para>
					As an example, the next statement uses the <literal>arrival_time</literal> property of <literal>MyTimestampedEvent</literal> events to order and release events by arrival time:
				</para>
				<programlisting><![CDATA[insert into ArrivalTimeOrderedStream
select rstream * from MyTimestampedEvent.ext:time_order(arrival_time, 10 sec)]]></programlisting>

				<para>
					In the example above, the <literal>arrival_time</literal> property holds a long-typed timestamp value in milliseconds. On arrival of an event, the engine compares the timestamp value of each event to the tail-time of the window. The tail-time of the window is, in this example, 10 seconds before engine time (continuously sliding). If the timestamp value indicates that the event is older then the tail-time of the time window, the event is released immediately in the remove stream. If the timestamp value indicates that the event is newer then the tail-time of the window, the view retains the event until engine time moves such that the event timestamp is older then tail-time.
				</para> 

				<para>
					The examples thus holds each arriving event in memory anywhere from zero seconds to 10 seconds, to allow for older events (considering arrival time timestamp) to arrive. In other words, the view holds an event with an arrival time equal to engine time for 10 seconds. The view holds an event with an arrival time that is 2 seconds older then engine time for 8 seconds. The view holds an event with an arrival time that is 10 or more seconds older then engine time for zero seconds, and releases such (old) events immediately into the remove stream. 
				</para> 

				<para>
					The insert stream of this sliding window consists of all arriving events. The remove stream of the view is ordered by timestamp value: The event that has the oldest timestamp value is released first, followed by the next newer events. Note the statement above uses the <literal>rstream</literal> keyword to select ordered events only and uses the <literal>insert into</literal> clause to makes such ordered stream available for subsequent statements to use.
				</para> 

				<para>
					It is up to your application to populate the timestamp property into your events for consideration by the view. The view also works well if you use externally-provided time via timer events.
