        <title>EQL Introduction</title>

        <para>
			EQL statements are used to derive and aggregate information from one or more streams of events, and to join or merge event streams. This section outlines EQL syntax. It also outlines the built-in views, which are the building blocks for deriving and aggregating information from event streams. 
        </para>
        
        <para>
			EQL is similar to SQL in its use of the <literal>select</literal> clause and the <literal>where</literal> clause. Where EQL differs most from SQL is in the use of tables. EQL replaces tables with the concept of event streams.
        </para>

        <para>
			EQL statements contain definitions of one or more views. Similar to tables in an SQL statement, views define the data available for querying and filtering. 
			Some views represent windows over a stream of events. Other views derive statistics from event properties, group events or handle unique event property values.
            Views can be staggered onto each other to build a chain of views. The Esper engine makes sure that views are reused among EQL statements for efficiency.
        </para>
        
        <para>
			The built-in set of views is:
         </para>

		<orderedlist spacing="compact">
			<listitem>
				<para>
					Views that represent moving event windows: <literal>win:length</literal>, <literal>win:time</literal>, <literal>win:time_batch</literal>, <literal>win:ext_time</literal>, <literal>ext:sort_window</literal>
				</para>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>

					Views for aggregation: <literal>std:unique</literal>, <literal>std:groupby</literal>, <literal>std:lastevent</literal> (note: the <literal>group-by</literal> clause and the <literal>std:groupby</literal> view are very similar in function, see view description for differences)

        <title>EQL Syntax</title>
        
		<para>
			EQL queries are created and stored in the engine, and publish results as events are received by the engine or timer events occur that match the criteria specified in the query. Events can also be pulled from running EQL queries.
		</para>

		<para>
			The select clause in an EQL query specifies the event properties or events to retrieve. The <literal>from</literal> clause in an EQL query specifies the event stream definitions and stream names to use. The <literal>where</literal> clause in an EQL query specifies search conditions that specify which event or event combination to search for. For example, the following statement returns the average price for IBM stock ticks in the last 30 seconds.
		</para>

			<programlisting><![CDATA[select avg(price) from StockTick.win:time(30) where symbol='IBM']]></programlisting>

		<para>
			EQL queries follow the below syntax. EQL queries can be simple queries or more complex queries. A simple select contains only a select clause and a single stream definition. Complex EQL queries can be build that feature a more elaborate select list utilizing expressions, may join multiple streams, may contain a where clause with search conditions and so on.

			The select clause is required in all EQL statements. The select clause can be used to select all properties via the wildcard <literal>*</literal>, or to specify a list of event properties and expressions. The select clause defines the event type (event property names and types) of the resulting events published by the statement, or pulled from the statement.

        <title>Specifying Event Streams : the <emphasis>From</emphasis> Clause</title>

		<para>
			The <literal>from</literal> clause is required in all EQL statements. It specifies one or more event streams. Each event stream can optionally be given a name by means of the <literal>as</literal> syntax.

			The event stream definition <emphasis>stream_def</emphasis> as shown in the syntax above consists of an event type, an optional filter property list and an optional list of views that derive data from a stream must be supplied. The syntax for an event stream definition is as below:
		</para>

		<synopsis><emphasis>event_type</emphasis> ( [<emphasis>filter_criteria</emphasis>] ) [.<emphasis>view_spec</emphasis>] [.<emphasis>view_spec</emphasis>] [...]</synopsis>

		<para>
			The following EQL statement selects all event properties for the last 100 events of IBM stock ticks for volume. In the example, the event type is the fully qualified Java class name <literal>org.esper.example.StockTick</literal>. The expression filters for events where the property <literal>symbol</literal> has a value of "IBM". The optional view specifications for deriving data from the StockTick events are a length window and a view for computing statistics on volume. The name for the event stream is "volumeStats".

		<para>
			Instead of the fully-qualified Java class name any other event name can be mapped via Configuration to a Java class, making the resulting statement more readable.

        <sect2 id="eql-from-clause-event-type" >
           <title>Specifying an event type</title>
			<para>
				In the example above the event type was <literal>org.esper.example.StockTick</literal>. The event type is simply the fully qualified Java class name. Interfaces and abstract classes are also supported. Alternatively, via configuration an alias for an event type can be defined and used instead of the fully qualified class name. The below example shows one way to obtain the fully qualified class name of a given Java class <literal>StockTick</literal>.

        <sect2 id="eql-from-clause-filter-criteria" >
           <title>Specifying event filter criteria</title>
			<para>
				Filter criteria follow the same syntax as outlined in the event pattern section on filters; see <xref linkend="pattern-filter"/>. Filter criteria operators are: <literal>=, &lt; , &gt; , &gt;=, &lt;=</literal>. Ranges use the <literal>in </literal> keyword and round <literal>(...)</literal> or square brackets <literal>[]</literal>.
			</para>
			
			<para>
				Esper filters out events in an event stream as defined by filter criteria before it sends events to subsequent views. Thus, compared to search conditions in a where-clause, filter criteria remove unneeded events early.
			</para>

			<para>
				The below example is a filter criteria list that removes events based on category, price and grade.
			</para>

        <sect2 id="eql-from-clause-view-spec" >
           <title>Specifying views</title>
			<para>
				Views are used to derive or aggregate data. Views can be staggered onto each other. See the section <xref linkend="built-in-views"/> on the views available.
			</para>
						
			<para>
				Views can optionally take one or parameters. These parameters can consist of primitive constants such as String, boolean or numeric types. Arrays are also supported as a view parameter types.
			</para>

			<para>
				The below example serves to show views and staggering of views. It uses a car location event that contains information about the location of a car on a highway. 
			</para>
				
			<para>
				The first view <literal>std:groupby('carId')</literal> groups car location events by car id. The second view <literal>win:length(4)</literal> keeps a length window of the 4 last events, with one length window for each car id. The next view <literal>std:groupby({'expressway', 'direction', 'segment'})</literal> groups each event by it's expressway, direction and segment property values. Again, the grouping is done for each car id considering the last 4 events only. The last view <literal>std:size()</literal> is used to report the number of events. Thus the below example reports the number of events per car id and per expressway, direction and segment considering the last 4 events for each car id only. 
			</para>

				<title>Using aggregate functions</title>
			
				<para>
					The aggregate functions are <literal>sum, avg, count, max, min, median, stddev, avedev</literal>. You can use aggregate functions to
					calculate and summarize data from event properties.
					For example, to find out the total price for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds, type:
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select sum(price) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30)</programlisting>

				<para>
					Here is the syntax for aggregate functions: 
				</para>
				<synopsis><emphasis>aggregate_function</emphasis>( [all | distinct] <emphasis>expression</emphasis>)</synopsis>

				<para>
					You can apply aggregate functions to all events in an event stream window or other view, or to one or more groups of events. From each set of events to which 
					an aggregate function is applied, Esper generates a single value. 
				</para>

				<para>
					<literal>Expression</literal> is usually an event property name. However it can also be a constant, function, or any combination of event property names, constants, 
					and functions connected by arithmetic operators.
				</para>

				<para>
					For example, to find out the average price for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds if the price was doubled:
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select avg(price * 2) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30)</programlisting>

				<para>
					You can use the optional keyword <literal>distinct</literal> with all aggregate functions to eliminate duplicate values before the aggregate function is applied. The optional 
					keyword <literal>all</literal> which performs the operation on all events is the default. 
				</para>

				<para>

				<para>
					You can use aggregation functions in a <literal>select</literal> clause and in a <literal>having</literal> clause. You cannot use aggregate functions in a <literal>where</literal> clause, but you can use the where clause to restrict the events to which the aggregate is applied. The next query computes the average and sum of the price of stock tick events for the symbol IBM only, for the last 10 stock tick events regardless of their symbol.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select 'IBM stats' as title, avg(price) as avgPrice, sum(price) as sumPrice

				<para>
					In the above example the length window of 10 elements is not affected by the where-clause, i.e. all events enter and leave the length window regardless of their symbol. If we only care about the last 10 IBM events, we need to add filter criteria as below.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select 'IBM stats' as title, avg(price) as avgPrice, sum(price) as sumPrice

							You can use <literal>sum, avg, median, stddev, avedev</literal> with numeric event properties only

					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>

				<para>
					Esper ignores any null values returned by the event property or expression on which the aggregate function is operating, except for the <literal>count(*)</literal> function, which counts null values as well. All aggregate functions return null if the data set contains no events, or if all events in the data set contain only null values for the aggregated expression.

        <sect2 id="eql-grouping-group-by" >
				 <title>Organizing statement results into groups: the <emphasis>Group-by</emphasis> clause</title>
				<para>
					The <literal>group by</literal> clause is optional in all EQL statements. The <literal>group by</literal> clause divides the output of an EQL statement into groups. You can group by one or more event property names, or by the result of computed expressions. When used with aggregate functions, <literal>group by</literal> retrieves the calculations in each subgroup. You can use <literal>group by</literal> without aggregate functions, but generally that can produce confusing results.
				</para>
	
				<para>
					For example, the below statement returns the total price per symbol for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30) group by symbol</programlisting>
	
				<para>
					The syntax of the group by clause is:
				</para>
				<synopsis>group by <emphasis>arregate_free_expression</emphasis> [, <emphasis>arregate_free_expression</emphasis>] [, ...]</synopsis>
			
				<para>
					Esper places the following restrictions on expressions in the <literal>group by</literal> clause:
				</para>
	
				<orderedlist spacing="compact">
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Expressions in the <literal>group by</literal> cannot contain aggregate functions
						</para>
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						<para>
							Event properties that are used within aggregate functions in the <literal>select</literal> clause cannot also be used in a <literal>group by</literal> expression
						</para>
					</listitem>
				</orderedlist>
				
				<para>
					You can list more then one expression in the <literal>group by</literal> clause to nest groups. Once the sets are established with <literal>group by</literal> the aggregation
					functions are applied. This statement posts the median volume for all stock tick events in the last 30 seconds per symbol and tick data feed. Esper posts one event for each group to statement listeners:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, tickDataFeed, median(volume) 
from StockTickEvent.win:time(30) 
group by symbol, tickDataFeed</programlisting>
				
				<para>
					In the statement above the event properties in the <literal>select</literal> list (symbol, tickDataFeed) are also listed in the <literal>group by</literal> clause.
					The statement thus follows the SQL standard which prescribes that non-aggregated event properties in the <literal>select</literal> list must match the 
					<literal>group by</literal> columns.
				</para>

				<para>
					Esper also supports statements in which one or more event properties in the <literal>select</literal> list are not listed in the <literal>group by</literal> clause.
					The statement below demonstrates this case. It calculates the standard deviation for the last 30 seconds of stock ticks aggregating by symbol and posting for 
					each event the symbol, tickDataFeed and the standard deviation on price.
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, tickDataFeed, stddev(price) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30) group by symbol</programlisting>
				
				<para>
					The above example still aggregates the <literal>price</literal> event property based on the <literal>symbol</literal>, but produces one event per incoming event, not one 
					event per group.
				</para>

				<para>
					Additionally, Esper supports statements in which one or more event properties in the <literal>group by</literal> clause are not listed in the <literal>select</literal> list.
					This is an example that calculates the mean deviation per <literal>symbol</literal> and <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> and posts one event per group with <literal>symbol</literal> and mean deviation of price in the generated events. Since tickDataFeed is not in the posted results, this can potentially be confusing.
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, avedev(price) 
from StockTickEvent.win:time(30) 
group by symbol, tickDataFeed</programlisting>

				<para>
					Expressions are also allowed in the <literal>group by</literal> list:
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol * price, count(*) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30) group by symbol * price</programlisting>
				
				<para>
					If the <literal>group by</literal> expression resulted in a null value, the null value becomes its own group. All null values are aggregated into the same group. If you are using the <literal>count(expression)</literal> aggregate function which does not count null values, the count returns zero if only null values are encountered.								
				</para>

				<para>
					You can use a <literal>where</literal>	clause in a statement with <literal>group by</literal>. Events that do not satisfy the conditions in the <literal>where</literal> clause are eliminated before any grouping is done. For example, the statement below posts the number of stock ticks in the last 30 seconds with a volume larger then 100, posting one event per group (symbol).
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, count(*) from StockTickEvent.win:time(30) where volume &gt; 100 group by symbol</programlisting>
		</sect2>

        <sect2 id="eql-grouping-having" >
			 <title>Selecting groups of events: the <emphasis>Having</emphasis> clause</title>
				<para>
					Use the <literal>having</literal> clause to pass or reject events defined by the <literal>group-by</literal> clause. The <literal>having</literal> clause sets conditions for the <literal>group by</literal> clause in the same way <literal>where</literal> sets conditions for the <literal>select</literal> clause, except <literal>where</literal> cannot include aggregate functions, while <literal>having</literal> often does.
				</para>
			
				<para>
					This statement is an example of a <literal>having</literal> clause with an aggregate function. It posts the total price per symbol for the last 30 seconds of stock tick events for only those symbols in which the total price exceeds 1000. The <literal>having</literal> clause eliminates all symbols where the total price is equal or less then 1000.
				</para>
				<programlisting>select symbol, sum(price) 
from StockTickEvent.win:time(30) 
group by symbol 
having sum(price) &gt; 1000</programlisting>

				<para>
					To include more then one condition in the <literal>having</literal> clause combine the conditions with <literal>and</literal>, <literal>or</literal> or <literal>not</literal>.
					This is shown in the statement below which selects only groups with a total price greater then 1000 and an average volume less then 500.

				<para>
					Esper filters events using the filter criteria for the event stream <literal>StockTickEvent</literal>. In the example above only events with symbol IBM enter the length window over the last 10 events, all other events are simply discarded. The <literal>where</literal> clause removes any events posted by the length window (events entering the window and event leaving the window) that do not match the condition of volume greater then 1000. Remaining events are applied to the <literal>stddev</literal> standard deviation aggregate function for each tick data feed as specified in the <literal>group by</literal> clause. Each <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> value generates one event. Esper applies the <literal>having</literal> clause and only lets events pass for <literal>tickDataFeed</literal> groups with a standard deviation of price greater then 0.8.

        <sect2 id="eql-output-options" >
				<title>Output Clause Options</title>
			
				<para>
				The <literal>output</literal> clause is optional in Esper and is used to control or stabilize the rate at which events are output. For example, the following statement batches old and new events and outputs them at the end of every 90 second interval.				
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select * from StockTickEvent.win:length(5) output every 90 seconds</programlisting>

				<para>
					Here is the syntax for output rate limiting: 
				</para>
				<synopsis>output [all | first | last] every <emphasis>number</emphasis> [minutes | seconds | events]</synopsis>

				<para>
					The <literal>all</literal> keyword is the default and specifies that all events in a batch should be output. The batch size can be specified in terms of time or number of events.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>first</literal> keyword specifies that only the first event in an output batch is to be output.
					Using the <literal>first</literal> keyword instructs the engine to output the first matching event as soon as it arrives, and then ignore matching events for the time interval or number of events specified. 
					After the time interval elapsed, or the number of matching events has been reached, the next first matching event is output again and the following interval the engine again ignores matching events.
				</para>

				<para>
					The <literal>last</literal> keyword specifies to only output the last event at the end of the given time interval or after the given number of matching events
					have been accumulated.
				</para>

				<para>
					The time interval can also be specified in terms of minutes; the following statement is identical to the first one.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select * from StockTickEvent.win:length(5) output every 1.5 minutes</programlisting>

				<para>
					A second way that output can be stabilized is by batching events until a certain number of events have been collected. The next statement only outputs when either 5 (or more) new or 5 (or more) old events have been batched.
				</para>				
			    <programlisting>select * from StockTickEvent.win:time(30) output every 5 events</programlisting>
			    
				<para>
					Additionally, event output can be further modified by the optional <literal>last</literal> keyword, which causes output of only the last event to arrive into an output batch.
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select * from StockTickEvent.win:time(30) output last every 5 events</programlisting>

				<para>
					Using the <literal>first</literal> keyword you can be notified at the start of the interval. The allows to watch for situations such as a rate falling below a threshold
					and only be informed every now and again after the specified output interval, but be informed the moment it first happens. 
				</para>
			    <programlisting>select * from TickRate.win:time(30) output first every 60 seconds where rate&lt;100</programlisting>

        <sect2 id="eql-output-groupby" >
				<title>Group By, Having and Output clause interaction</title>
			
				<para>
					The <literal>output</literal> clause interacts in two ways with the <literal>group by</literal> and <literal>having</literal> clauses. First, in the <literal>output every n events </literal>case, the number <literal>n</literal> refers to the number of events arriving into the <literal>group by clause</literal>. That is, if the <literal>group by</literal> clause outputs only 1 event per group, or if the arriving events don't satisfy the <literal>having</literal> clause, then the actual number of events output by the statement could be fewer than <literal>n</literal>.
				</para>
				<para>
Second, the <literal>last</literal> and <literal>all</literal> keywords have special meanings when used in a statement with aggregate functions and the <literal>group by</literal> clause. The <literal>last</literal> keyword specifies that only groups whose aggregate values have been updated with the most recent batch of events should be output. The <literal>all</literal> keyword (the default) specifies that the most recent data for all groups seen so far should be output, whether or not these groups' aggregate values have just been updated.

        <title>Sorting Output: the <emphasis>Order By</emphasis> Clause</title>

		<para>
			The <literal>order by</literal> clause is optional in Esper. It is used for ordering output events by their properties, or by expressions involving those properties. For example, the following statement outputs batches of 5 or more stock tick events that are sorted first by price and then by volume.				
		</para>

		<programlisting>select symbol from StockTickEvent.win:time(60)

        <title>Merging Streams and Continuous Insertion: the <emphasis>Insert Into</emphasis> Clause</title>

		<para>
			The <literal>insert into</literal> clause is optional in Esper. This clause can be specified to make the results of a statement available as an event stream for use
			in further statements. The clause can also be used to merge multiple event streams to form a single stream of events.
		</para>

		<programlisting>insert into CombinedEvent

Each generated <literal>CombinedEvent</literal> event has 2 event properties named "custId" and "latency". The events generated by above statement can be used in further statements. The below statement uses the generated events.		
		</para>

  from CombinedEvent.win:time(1800)
 group by custId</programlisting>

		<para>
			The <literal>insert into</literal> clause can consist of just an event type alias, or of an event type alias and 1 or more event property names.			
			The syntax for the <literal>insert into</literal> clause is as follows:
		</para>

		<synopsis>insert [istream | rstream] into <emphasis>event_type_alias</emphasis>  [ (<emphasis>property_name</emphasis> [, property_name] ) ]</synopsis>

		<para>
			The <literal>istream</literal> (default) and <literal>rstream</literal> keywords are optional. If neither keyword or the <literal>istream</literal> keyword is specified, the engine supplies the insert stream events generated by the statement. The insert stream consists of the events entering the respective window(s) or stream(s). If the <literal>rstream</literal> keyword is specified, the engine supplies the remove stream events generated by the statement. The remove stream consists of the events leaving the respective window(s). 
		</para>

		<para>
			The <literal>event_type_alias</literal> is an identifier that names the events generated by the engine. The identifier can be used in statements to filter and
			process events of the given name.
		</para>

		<para>
			The engine also allows listeners to be attached to a statement that contain an <literal>insert into</literal> clause.
		</para>

		<para>
			Esper places the following restrictions on the <literal>insert into</literal> clause:
		</para>
		
		<orderedlist spacing="compact">
			<listitem>
				<para>
					The number of elements in the <literal>select</literal> clause must match the number of elements in the <literal>insert into</literal> clause if the clause specifies a list of event property names

			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<para>
					If the event type alias has already been defined by a prior statement or configuration, and the event property names and types do not match, an exception is thrown at statement creation time.

		<para>
			The example statement below shows the alternative form of the <literal>insert into</literal> clause that explicitly defines the property names to use.

		<programlisting>insert into CombinedEvent (custId, latency)
select A.customerId, A.timestamp - B.timestamp 
...</programlisting>

		<para>
			The <literal>rstream</literal> keyword can be useful to indicate to the engine to generate only remove stream events. This can be useful if we want to trigger 
			actions when events leave a window rather then when events enter a window. The statement below generates <literal>CombinedEvent</literal> events when
			EventA and EventB leave the window after 30 minutes (1800 seconds).
		</para>

		<programlisting>insert rstream into CombinedEvent
select A.customerId as custId, A.timestamp - B.timestamp as latency

        <title>Joining Event Streams</title>

		<para>
			Two or more event streams can be part of the <literal>from</literal> clause and thus both streams determine the resulting events. The where-clause lists the join conditions that Esper uses to relate events in the two or more streams.
		</para>

		<para>
			Each point in time that an event arrives to one of the event streams, the two event streams are joined and output events are produced according to the where-clause.
		</para>

		<para>
			This example joins 2 event streams. The first event stream consists of fraud warning events for which we keep the last 30 minutes (1800 seconds). The second stream is withdrawal events for which we consider the last 30 seconds. The streams are joined on account number.
		</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[select fraud.accountNumber as accntNum, fraud.warning as warn, withdraw.amount as amount,
       max(fraud.timestamp, withdraw.timestamp) as timestamp, 'withdrawlFraud' as desc

        <title>Outer Joins</title>

		<para>
			Esper supports left outer joins, right outer joins and full outer joins between an unlimited number of event streams.
		</para>

		<para>
			If the outer join is a left outer join, there will be an output event for each event of the stream on the left-hand side of the clause. For example, in the left outer join shown below we will get output for each event in the stream RfidEvent, even if the event does not match any event in the event stream OrderList.
		</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from net.esper.example.rfid.RfidEvent.win:time(30) as rfid
       left outer join
       net.esper.example.rfid.OrderList.win:length(10000) as orderlist
     on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId]]></programlisting>
		
		<para>
			Similarly, if the join is a Right Outer Join, then there will be an output event for each event of the stream on the right-hand side of the clause. For example, in the right outer join shown below we will get output for each event in the stream OrderList, even if the event does not match any event in the event stream RfidEvent.
		</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from net.esper.example.rfid.RfidEvent.win:time(30) as rfid
       right outer join
       net.esper.example.rfid.OrderList.win:length(10000) as orderlist
     on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			For all types of outer joins, if the join condition is not met, the select list is computed with the event properties of the arrived event while all other event properties are considered to be null.
		</para>
		
<programlisting><![CDATA[select * from net.esper.example.rfid.RfidEvent.win:time(30) as rfid

     on rfid.itemId = orderList.itemId]]></programlisting>

		<para>
			The last type of outer join is a full outer join. In a full outer join, each point in time that an event arrives to one of the event streams, one or more output events are produced. In the example below, when either an RfidEvent or an OrderList event arrive, one or more output event is produced.
